Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.

Sarah:  Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?

Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?

Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?

Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.


Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?

Joe:  Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.


Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

**Previous Context**:
My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.

**Sarah:**  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.

**Joe:**  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.

**Sarah:** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?

**Joe:** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.

**Joe:**  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.

**Sarah:**  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.

**Joe:**  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.

**Sarah:** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?

**Joe:**  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.

**Sarah:**  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?

**Joe:**  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.  

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?

**Joe:** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.

**Sarah:**  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?

**Joe:** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.

**Sarah:**  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?

**Joe:** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.

**Sarah:** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

    "text": "** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers."

** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?

**Sarah:** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?

**Joe:**  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.

**Sarah:**  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?

**Joe:** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?

**Joe:**  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.

**Joe:**  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.

**Sarah:**  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.

**Joe:**  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?

**Joe:** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.

**Sarah:**  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.

**Sarah:** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.

**Joe:** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.


**Sarah:** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.


**Joe:** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.


**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?
[INFO] Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?
[INFO] Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?
[INFO] Joe: **  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?
[INFO] Joe: ** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?
[INFO] Sarah: ** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?
[INFO] Joe: **  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?
[INFO] Joe: ** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.
[INFO] Sarah: ** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of biomedical research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies, which, uh, has been a major headache for scientists for decades.

Sarah:  A headache?  I can imagine.  So, what exactly is the problem?  Is it just that some antibodies don't work as well as others?  Or is it something more systemic?

Joe:  It's more systemic, unfortunately.  Um, you see, scientists use antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  The ideal antibody only binds to *one* particular protein, ignoring everything else.  But, for years, many commercially available antibodies haven't been doing that.  They're either not binding to the target protein at all, or they're binding to other proteins too, giving inaccurate results.

Sarah:  So, false positives, essentially?  And this has been happening for decades?  Wow. That's a huge problem.  How many studies might be affected by this?

Joe:  Exactly, false positives, and sometimes false negatives.  And the scale is... staggering.  One study highlighted how a single antibody, that turned out not to work correctly, was used in over 15 papers, cited over 3,000 times.  Think about the implications of that.  Years of research, potentially millions of dollars, all based on flawed data.

Sarah:  That's... alarming.  So, what's being done about it?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies that sell these antibodies?

Joe:  It's more than that. It's a multi-pronged approach.  One major initiative is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  Their goal is to rigorously test commercially available antibodies for every human protein. It's a huge undertaking, but it's essential for cleaning up the field.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production techniques, making them more reliable and specific.  And, of course, there's a push for better practices within the scientific community—more rigorous testing before publishing results that rely on these antibodies.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of better technology, better quality control, and better practices.  That makes sense.  But, I mean, how can we ever really be sure we've identified *all* the problematic antibodies?  It seems like a never-ending task.

Joe:  Yeah, it's a huge challenge.  And, you know, it's not just about identifying bad antibodies. It's about establishing trust in the data.  This whole situation highlights the importance of open science and data sharing.  The more transparent the process, the better we can identify and correct these errors.  It's a long road, but initiatives like iCharOS are really trying to make a difference.  And frankly,  we need them to. The reproducibility crisis in science is a real issue, and unreliable reagents like these antibodies are a big part of the problem.


Sarah:  Absolutely. Thanks for shedding light on this crucial issue, Joe.  It's a reminder that even the fundamental tools of scientific research aren't always as reliable as we might hope.  This has been a really eye-opening conversation.


Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks again for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.

My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks again for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody validation efforts, particularly YCharOS.  It really highlights a significant problem in research, right?  The sheer number of antibodies on the market, and the surprisingly high failure rate.

**Sarah:**  Exactly, Joe.  It's mind-boggling. Seven point seven *million* antibody products...and a substantial portion don't perform as advertised.  It makes you wonder about the reliability of so much published research, doesn't it?  I mean, what's the impact of using a faulty antibody on the results of a study?

**Joe:**  Huge.  A faulty antibody can lead to completely inaccurate results, wasted time, and resources, and potentially, incorrect conclusions that could impact further research down the line.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – the knock-out cell line, as you mentioned – is pretty straightforward, but effective.  It's a direct way to assess specificity.

**Sarah:**  So, the knock-out cell line acts as a kind of negative control, right?  A way to see if the antibody is binding to something *other* than the intended target?

**Joe:** Precisely.  It's a crucial control.  If the antibody binds to the knock-out cell line, which lacks the target protein, that indicates a lack of specificity – it's binding non-specifically to something else.  That's a major red flag.

**Sarah:**  Makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiative you mentioned, OMAPs?  How does their approach differ?

**Joe:**  OMAPs takes a different tack.  Instead of focusing on rigorous characterization across various applications in a single context like YCharOS, they focus on a *single* application – multiplex imaging – but across *multiple* contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach.

**Sarah:**  So, YCharOS is like a deep dive into the antibody's fundamental performance, while OMAPs is more about validating its performance in specific experimental setups?  Is that a fair summary?

**Joe:**  Yeah, that's a pretty good summary.  YCharOS prioritizes fundamental validation; OMAPs focuses on application-specific validation within a broader range of experimental conditions.  Both approaches are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  You know, it's a collaborative effort, which I think is crucial.  The sheer scale of the problem requires a multifaceted approach.

**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  And the fact that YCharOS has managed to get so many antibody suppliers on board is remarkable.  It speaks to a growing recognition of the need for quality control in this area.  But it also raises a question:  is this level of collaboration sustainable?  Can they maintain this level of cooperation in the long term?

**Joe:** That's a good question, and a critical one for the long-term success of initiatives like YCharOS. Maintaining that level of cooperation and funding will be a significant challenge.  But the potential benefits – improved research reliability, reduced wasted resources – are substantial.  It's a vital area to address.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone!  Today, we’re diving deep into the world of antibodies – specifically, the surprisingly tricky business of finding reliable ones.  Joe, thanks for joining us again.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. It's a fascinating, and frankly, frustrating topic.  We've all been there – spending weeks, sometimes months, chasing down the right antibody, only to discover it doesn't work as advertised.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  I remember reading that study about how difficult it was to even *find* the antibodies mentioned in published papers.  Ninety percent lacked catalogue numbers, right?  That's insane!

**Joe:**  Yeah, it's a huge problem.  That's why initiatives like SciCrunch and the development of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) are so crucial.  Essentially, RRIDs are unique, persistent identifiers for research resources, including antibodies.  Think of them as permanent digital labels that prevent the loss of information when a company discontinues a product or if catalogue numbers are duplicated across different vendors.

**Sarah:** So, it's like a universal product code, but specifically for scientific reagents?

**Joe:**  You could think of it that way,  but more robust.  It's designed to be persistent, even if the vendor changes or the product number changes.  The RRID remains constant, allowing researchers to reliably track down the specific antibody used in a study.  The goal is to make research more reproducible.

**Sarah:**  That makes perfect sense.  But even if you *can* find an antibody using RRIDs, how do you know it's *good*?  That's where things seem to get really messy, isn't it?

**Joe:** That's the million-dollar question, Sarah.  CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that helps researchers find highly cited antibodies.  They're trying to improve things by including validation information when available.  But, and this is a big but,  the validation process itself is complex.  There's no single, universally accepted standard.

**Sarah:** So, what *is* considered good validation?  I mean, what are researchers looking for?

**Joe:** Well, "knock-out" validation is often cited as the gold standard.  It involves showing that the antibody specifically targets the intended protein and doesn't cross-react with other proteins.  But less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have undergone this rigorous validation process.

**Sarah:**  Wow. That's a tiny percentage.  So, what are researchers doing in the meantime?  Just hoping for the best?

**Joe:**  Um, unfortunately, it often feels that way.  There's a lot of trial and error involved.  The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is trying to address this by bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – basically, all the stakeholders – to discuss solutions and improve standards.

**Sarah:**  That sounds like a really important initiative.  It highlights the need for collaboration across the entire research ecosystem, right?  It's not just about one group fixing the problem.

**Joe:** Exactly.  It's a systemic issue, and it requires a systemic solution.  It's a long road, but hopefully, through initiatives like OGA, we can make significant improvements in the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.

**(Outro music fades in)**

**Sarah:**  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey. Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 **(Sound of a gentle transition between segments)**

**Sarah:**  So Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies!  It's fascinating, but honestly, some of it went a little over my head.  Can you break down the key difference between the "old" way of making antibodies and these new "recombinant" ones?

**Joe:** Sure, Sarah.  The main difference boils down to the *production method*.  The older methods involved using immune cells, either directly or hybrids with cancer cells, to produce antibodies.  This process is, um, less precise and leads to batch-to-batch variability.  Essentially, you might get slightly different antibodies each time you make a batch.

**Sarah:**  So like, baking a cake without a recipe? Each one is slightly different?

**Joe:**  I guess you could use that analogy, although the variations are more subtle than a cake. It's more like, you're aiming for a specific protein, and the older methods might sometimes hit the target perfectly, sometimes close, and sometimes, well, miss completely.  The key is the consistency is lacking.

**Sarah:** Okay, I get that.  And the recombinant method fixes that?

**Joe:** Yes. Recombinant antibodies are made using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are *programmed* to produce a specific antibody sequence. It's like having a precise recipe, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.  You get the same antibody, every time, in every batch. This eliminates the batch-to-batch variation that plagued the older methods.

**Sarah:**  So, that's a huge improvement for research, right?  Less variability means more reliable results.

**Joe:** Exactly.  More reliable results mean more reproducible research, which is a massive issue in science. Think about it – if two labs are using different batches of the same antibody and getting different results, it's hard to draw solid conclusions.  Recombinant antibodies help mitigate that.

**Sarah:**  It sounds like a simple solution, but the article mentioned that scientists are still resistant to change. Why is that?

**Joe:** That's a complex issue.  There's inertia, of course. Scientists are used to what they know, and switching to new methods requires effort and potentially retraining.  There's also the issue of sunk costs – if a researcher has already invested significant time and resources using a particular antibody, they might be hesitant to switch, even if there are known issues with it.  Sometimes, they're getting results they're happy with, regardless of the underlying quality of the antibody.  Ultimately,  the responsibility for validation still lies with the researcher.

**Sarah:**  So even with better antibodies, researchers still need to do their due diligence?

**Joe:** Absolutely.  The shift to recombinant antibodies is a huge step forward, but it doesn't eliminate the need for thorough validation.  It just makes the process significantly more reliable and easier to control from the start.

**Sarah:** So, it's less about a complete solution, and more about making the whole process vastly more efficient and reliable.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. That makes a lot more sense now.

**Joe:** You're welcome, Sarah. It's a complex field, but the progress being made is significant.  Hopefully, this conversation helps our listeners understand the importance of antibody quality and the ongoing efforts to improve it.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 (Sound of a gentle microphone adjustment)

**Joe:** So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, validating antibodies.  It's a crucial step, you know?  Because, um, you can't just assume an antibody works as expected.  You need proof.

**Sarah:** Right. And that's what I found a little…daunting in the last segment.  All those methods – immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation… it all sounded quite complicated.  Could you maybe break it down a bit more simply?  For the, uh, less scientifically inclined listener?

**Joe:** Sure.  Okay, so let's start with immunohistochemistry, or IHC. Think of it like this: you have a bunch of cells, right? Some of these cells have a specific protein we're interested in – let's call it "Protein X."  We use an antibody designed to bind specifically to Protein X.  If the antibody works, it will stick to the cells containing Protein X, and we can see them under a microscope.  It's a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:**  So, it's like… highlighting the cells with Protein X?  A visual tag?

**Joe:** Exactly!  A visual tag.  Simple, right? Now, Western blotting is a bit different.  Here, we take a sample of proteins, separate them by size using gel electrophoresis, and then use our antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  It’s like…finding a specific piece in a jigsaw puzzle based on its size.

**Sarah:** Okay, I think I’m getting it.  So IHC is a visual check on cells, and Western blotting is a size-based check on proteins.  What about immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** Immunoprecipitation, or IP, is more about isolating the protein of interest.  We use the antibody as a kind of magnet to pull out Protein X from a complex mixture of proteins. Then, we can further analyze what we've pulled out, often using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  It's a more precise method.

**Sarah:** So,  we're using the antibody to fish out the specific protein we're interested in?  That makes sense.  It sounds like each method offers a different kind of confirmation, reinforcing the reliability of the antibody.

**Joe:** Precisely.  Using multiple methods is key.  It's a bit like having multiple witnesses to confirm a story; it increases the confidence in the results.  No single method is foolproof, but combining them gives us a much more robust validation.  It’s… well, it’s essential for reliable research.

**Sarah:**  That’s a helpful analogy, actually.  So, a combination of these techniques allows researchers to be confident that their antibody is indeed doing what it's supposed to do.  That's… reassuring, I guess.  It sounds like a lot of work though!

**Joe:**  It is!  But it's crucial work.  The reliability of our antibodies directly impacts the reliability of the research findings.  And that, ultimately, affects the development of new treatments and diagnostic tools.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  This has been incredibly enlightening, Joe. Thank you for clarifying all that.

**Joe:** You're welcome, Sarah. It's a complex field, but the progress being made is significant. Hopefully, this conversation helps our listeners understand the importance of antibody quality and the ongoing efforts to improve it.

**Sarah:**  Definitely.  I think our listeners have a much clearer understanding now.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of biomedical research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies, which, uh, has been a major headache for scientists for decades.
[INFO] Sarah: A headache?  I can imagine.  So, what exactly is the problem?  Is it just that some antibodies don't work as well as others?  Or is it something more systemic?
[INFO] Joe: It's more systemic, unfortunately.  Um, you see, scientists use antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  The ideal antibody only binds to *one* particular protein, ignoring everything else.  But, for years, many commercially available antibodies haven't been doing that.  They're either not binding to the target protein at all, or they're binding to other proteins too, giving inaccurate results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, false positives, essentially?  And this has been happening for decades?  Wow. That's a huge problem.  How many studies might be affected by this?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly, false positives, and sometimes false negatives.  And the scale is... staggering.  One study highlighted how a single antibody, that turned out not to work correctly, was used in over 15 papers, cited over 3,000 times.  Think about the implications of that.  Years of research, potentially millions of dollars, all based on flawed data.
[INFO] Sarah: That's... alarming.  So, what's being done about it?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies that sell these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: It's more than that. It's a multi-pronged approach.  One major initiative is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  Their goal is to rigorously test commercially available antibodies for every human protein. It's a huge undertaking, but it's essential for cleaning up the field.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production techniques, making them more reliable and specific.  And, of course, there's a push for better practices within the scientific community—more rigorous testing before publishing results that rely on these antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of better technology, better quality control, and better practices.  That makes sense.  But, I mean, how can we ever really be sure we've identified *all* the problematic antibodies?  It seems like a never-ending task.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a huge challenge.  And, you know, it's not just about identifying bad antibodies. It's about establishing trust in the data.  This whole situation highlights the importance of open science and data sharing.  The more transparent the process, the better we can identify and correct these errors.  It's a long road, but initiatives like iCharOS are really trying to make a difference.  And frankly,  we need them to. The reproducibility crisis in science is a real issue, and unreliable reagents like these antibodies are a big part of the problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for shedding light on this crucial issue, Joe.  It's a reminder that even the fundamental tools of scientific research aren't always as reliable as we might hope.  This has been a really eye-opening conversation.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks again for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody validation efforts, particularly YCharOS.  It really highlights a significant problem in research, right?  The sheer number of antibodies on the market, and the surprisingly high failure rate.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly, Joe.  It's mind-boggling. Seven point seven *million* antibody products...and a substantial portion don't perform as advertised.  It makes you wonder about the reliability of so much published research, doesn't it?  I mean, what's the impact of using a faulty antibody on the results of a study?
[INFO] Joe: **  Huge.  A faulty antibody can lead to completely inaccurate results, wasted time, and resources, and potentially, incorrect conclusions that could impact further research down the line.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – the knock-out cell line, as you mentioned – is pretty straightforward, but effective.  It's a direct way to assess specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, the knock-out cell line acts as a kind of negative control, right?  A way to see if the antibody is binding to something *other* than the intended target?
[INFO] Joe: ** Precisely.  It's a crucial control.  If the antibody binds to the knock-out cell line, which lacks the target protein, that indicates a lack of specificity – it's binding non-specifically to something else.  That's a major red flag.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiative you mentioned, OMAPs?  How does their approach differ?
[INFO] Joe: **  OMAPs takes a different tack.  Instead of focusing on rigorous characterization across various applications in a single context like YCharOS, they focus on a *single* application – multiplex imaging – but across *multiple* contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, YCharOS is like a deep dive into the antibody's fundamental performance, while OMAPs is more about validating its performance in specific experimental setups?  Is that a fair summary?
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, that's a pretty good summary.  YCharOS prioritizes fundamental validation; OMAPs focuses on application-specific validation within a broader range of experimental conditions.  Both approaches are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  You know, it's a collaborative effort, which I think is crucial.  The sheer scale of the problem requires a multifaceted approach.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  And the fact that YCharOS has managed to get so many antibody suppliers on board is remarkable.  It speaks to a growing recognition of the need for quality control in this area.  But it also raises a question:  is this level of collaboration sustainable?  Can they maintain this level of cooperation in the long term?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a good question, and a critical one for the long-term success of initiatives like YCharOS. Maintaining that level of cooperation and funding will be a significant challenge.  But the potential benefits – improved research reliability, reduced wasted resources – are substantial.  It's a vital area to address.
[INFO] Joe: **  And that's all the time we have for today, Sarah. Thanks for joining me.
[INFO] Sarah: ** My pleasure, Joe.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone!  Today, we’re diving deep into the world of antibodies – specifically, the surprisingly tricky business of finding reliable ones.  Joe, thanks for joining us again.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah. It's a fascinating, and frankly, frustrating topic.  We've all been there – spending weeks, sometimes months, chasing down the right antibody, only to discover it doesn't work as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Absolutely.  I remember reading that study about how difficult it was to even *find* the antibodies mentioned in published papers.  Ninety percent lacked catalogue numbers, right?  That's insane!
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, it's a huge problem.  That's why initiatives like SciCrunch and the development of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) are so crucial.  Essentially, RRIDs are unique, persistent identifiers for research resources, including antibodies.  Think of them as permanent digital labels that prevent the loss of information when a company discontinues a product or if catalogue numbers are duplicated across different vendors.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's like a universal product code, but specifically for scientific reagents?
[INFO] Joe: **  You could think of it that way,  but more robust.  It's designed to be persistent, even if the vendor changes or the product number changes.  The RRID remains constant, allowing researchers to reliably track down the specific antibody used in a study.  The goal is to make research more reproducible.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That makes perfect sense.  But even if you *can* find an antibody using RRIDs, how do you know it's *good*?  That's where things seem to get really messy, isn't it?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's the million-dollar question, Sarah.  CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that helps researchers find highly cited antibodies.  They're trying to improve things by including validation information when available.  But, and this is a big but,  the validation process itself is complex.  There's no single, universally accepted standard.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, what *is* considered good validation?  I mean, what are researchers looking for?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, "knock-out" validation is often cited as the gold standard.  It involves showing that the antibody specifically targets the intended protein and doesn't cross-react with other proteins.  But less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have undergone this rigorous validation process.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Wow. That's a tiny percentage.  So, what are researchers doing in the meantime?  Just hoping for the best?
[INFO] Joe: **  Um, unfortunately, it often feels that way.  There's a lot of trial and error involved.  The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is trying to address this by bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – basically, all the stakeholders – to discuss solutions and improve standards.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That sounds like a really important initiative.  It highlights the need for collaboration across the entire research ecosystem, right?  It's not just about one group fixing the problem.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  It's a systemic issue, and it requires a systemic solution.  It's a long road, but hopefully, through initiatives like OGA, we can make significant improvements in the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey. Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies!  It's fascinating, but honestly, some of it went a little over my head.  Can you break down the key difference between the "old" way of making antibodies and these new "recombinant" ones?
[INFO] Joe: ** Sure, Sarah.  The main difference boils down to the *production method*.  The older methods involved using immune cells, either directly or hybrids with cancer cells, to produce antibodies.  This process is, um, less precise and leads to batch-to-batch variability.  Essentially, you might get slightly different antibodies each time you make a batch.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So like, baking a cake without a recipe? Each one is slightly different?
[INFO] Joe: **  I guess you could use that analogy, although the variations are more subtle than a cake. It's more like, you're aiming for a specific protein, and the older methods might sometimes hit the target perfectly, sometimes close, and sometimes, well, miss completely.  The key is the consistency is lacking.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, I get that.  And the recombinant method fixes that?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes. Recombinant antibodies are made using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are *programmed* to produce a specific antibody sequence. It's like having a precise recipe, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.  You get the same antibody, every time, in every batch. This eliminates the batch-to-batch variation that plagued the older methods.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, that's a huge improvement for research, right?  Less variability means more reliable results.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  More reliable results mean more reproducible research, which is a massive issue in science. Think about it – if two labs are using different batches of the same antibody and getting different results, it's hard to draw solid conclusions.  Recombinant antibodies help mitigate that.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It sounds like a simple solution, but the article mentioned that scientists are still resistant to change. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a complex issue.  There's inertia, of course. Scientists are used to what they know, and switching to new methods requires effort and potentially retraining.  There's also the issue of sunk costs – if a researcher has already invested significant time and resources using a particular antibody, they might be hesitant to switch, even if there are known issues with it.  Sometimes, they're getting results they're happy with, regardless of the underlying quality of the antibody.  Ultimately,  the responsibility for validation still lies with the researcher.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So even with better antibodies, researchers still need to do their due diligence?
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  The shift to recombinant antibodies is a huge step forward, but it doesn't eliminate the need for thorough validation.  It just makes the process significantly more reliable and easier to control from the start.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's less about a complete solution, and more about making the whole process vastly more efficient and reliable.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. That makes a lot more sense now.
[INFO] Joe: ** You're welcome, Sarah. It's a complex field, but the progress being made is significant.  Hopefully, this conversation helps our listeners understand the importance of antibody quality and the ongoing efforts to improve it.
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, validating antibodies.  It's a crucial step, you know?  Because, um, you can't just assume an antibody works as expected.  You need proof.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a really fascinating – and frankly, slightly frustrating – area of biological research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies and how scientists are trying to fix it.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this "reproducibility crisis" in science.  Is this directly related?  And, um, can you explain what exactly the problem *is* with these antibodies?  I mean, I know they're used to, like, identify proteins and stuff, but...

Joe: Exactly.  The problem is that many commercially available antibodies – the ones scientists buy to use in their research – simply don't work as advertised.  They either don't bind to the target protein they're *supposed* to bind to, or they bind to other things too, giving you false results.  Think of it like… well,  maybe not an analogy, but imagine you're trying to find a specific screw in a toolbox, and your "antibody" is a magnet that sticks to *all* the metal, not just the screw.  It's useless.

Sarah:  Right, so it's a lack of specificity and selectivity, right?  You mentioned that earlier, I think.

Joe:  Precisely! Specificity means it only binds to the *one* target protein. Selectivity means it avoids binding to everything else.  And a lot of these antibodies are failing on both counts.  This researcher, Carl Laflamme,  he was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He was trying to figure out where this protein, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, is located within the cell.  He looked at sixteen different commercially available antibodies, supposed to bind to this protein… and only three actually worked properly.

Sarah:  Wow.  Only three out of sixteen?  That's... a pretty low success rate. So, what happened with the other thirteen?  Did they just not bind at all?  Or did they bind to the wrong things?

Joe:  Um, yeah, it was a mix.  Some didn't bind at all,  others bound to completely different proteins.  And the crazy thing is,  many of those poorly performing antibodies had been used in published studies –  studies that had been cited thousands of times!  So, you know, a huge amount of research might be based on flawed data.

Sarah: That’s… terrifying. So what are scientists doing to tackle this?  Is there a way to improve the quality of these antibodies?

Joe:  Absolutely. There are several initiatives underway.  One is this project called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science – which aims to systematically test *all* commercially available antibodies for human proteins.  Others are focusing on developing better antibody production methods. It’s a huge undertaking, but, you know, it’s really a necessary step to improve the reliability of biological research.  It’s about improving the tools of the trade, essentially.

Sarah:  It sounds like a massive project.  I guess it's a good example of how even seemingly small details, like the quality of an antibody, can have huge consequences for the entire field.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's a lot to wrap my head around, but it’s definitely important.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  And that’s it for this week’s Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we delve into…

**Previous Context**:
My pleasure, Sarah.  And that’s it for this week’s Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we delve into…

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, antibody validation.  The YCharOS initiative, fascinating stuff.  Essentially, they're tackling a huge problem: the reliability of commercially available antibodies.  Millions are on the market, but a significant portion don't perform as advertised.

Sarah: Right.  And that’s the crazy part!  Millions of antibodies, and a large percentage are unreliable.  It makes you wonder how much research is based on flawed data, doesn't it?  What's the core of their methodology?  You mentioned something about cell lines...

Joe:  Exactly.  YCharOS uses a comparative approach.  They test the antibody's specificity in two cell lines: one that expresses the target protein normally, and a "knock-out" line lacking that protein.  This allows them to directly assess whether the antibody binds specifically to the intended target, or if it's exhibiting cross-reactivity – binding to other things unintentionally.  It's a pretty straightforward, but powerful, method.

Sarah: So, a kind of "before-and-after" comparison?  Like, if it binds in the normal cell line but not in the knockout, you've got a good indication of specificity?

Joe:  Precisely.  It's a direct measure of specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line provides strong evidence that the antibody is actually targeting the intended protein and not something else.  It's a crucial control.  And, uhm...  YCharOS's success lies partly in its collaborative nature.  They've gotten antibody manufacturers on board, which is a huge step.

Sarah:  That's a significant element.  The fact that they're working with the manufacturers rather than just independently testing is key.  It seems like a much more effective approach to ensuring improvements are made.  I mean, what's the point of identifying a problem if you can’t get the source to address it?

Joe:  Exactly.  It's not just about identifying problems; it's about driving change.  They're not just publishing reports; they're working with the manufacturers to improve the antibodies or remove flawed ones from the market.  That’s a real game changer.

Sarah:  It’s impressive, really. But even with YCharOS, it's not a perfect solution, right?  You mentioned that the context matters.

Joe:  Right.  The way an antibody performs can vary depending on the specific application, tissue type, or even the experimental protocol used.  YCharOS focuses on a specific test context, but that doesn't guarantee performance in every situation.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in.  They're tackling validation across different contexts and applications, though their approach is…different.

Sarah:  So, YCharOS is focused on rigorous testing in a controlled environment, while OMAPs is more about community-based validation across a range of conditions?  A broader, less controlled approach?

Joe:  Yes,  OMAPs is more of a crowdsourced validation effort.  It utilizes a community of researchers to test antibodies in diverse contexts.  It's a different strategy, aiming for broader applicability, but potentially with less rigorous control over the testing conditions.  It’s a trade-off.

Sarah:  It's interesting to see these two different approaches, both tackling the same fundamental problem but with different strategies.  It highlights the complexity of antibody validation.  Thanks Joe, this has been incredibly insightful.  I feel much clearer on this now.


Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it.  And that's a wrap for this week's…

My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it.  And that's a wrap for this week's…

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Joe:  So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's a mess, really.  We talked about how hard it is to even *find* the right antibodies, let alone know if they're any good. Remember Anita Bandrowski's work with RRIDs?  That's a huge step forward in just tracking down the specific antibody used in a study.  Before RRIDs,  90% of antibodies cited in some journals lacked catalogue numbers – making replication practically impossible.

Sarah:  Right, the catalogue numbers.  That makes perfect sense.  But even if you *can* find the antibody, how do you know it's actually going to work as expected?  It sounds like a huge problem, and I’m curious, what's the biggest hurdle to overcome?  Is it the lack of standardization, or something else entirely?

Joe:  It's a multifaceted problem.  Lack of standardization is a big part of it, absolutely.  But also, the sheer variety in how antibodies are used.  Andrew Chalmers, with CiteAb, highlights this.  There's no single, universally accepted validation method.  Knock-out validation is often cited as the gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have that level of validation.  It's a huge gap.

Sarah:  Wow, less than 5%? That's...sobering.  So,  if knock-out validation is the gold standard, why isn't it more common? Is it just too expensive or time-consuming?

Joe:  It's both, I think.  It's resource-intensive, requiring specialized techniques and expertise.  Also, the incentive structure isn't always there.  Manufacturers might not prioritize it if there's not a strong market demand for fully validated antibodies.  Plus, many existing antibodies were developed before these rigorous validation methods became standard practice.

Sarah:  So it's a combination of historical issues and current practical limitations.  That makes sense.  You mentioned the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community. What's their approach?  Are they trying to force standardization or something more collaborative?

Joe:  OGA is taking a collaborative approach. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers – all the stakeholders – to discuss solutions.  It's about fostering a culture of transparency and better communication.  They’re trying to create a shared understanding of the problem and work towards better practices, rather than imposing strict regulations.  It's a more bottom-up approach, which I think is crucial given the complexity of the issue.

Sarah:  That sounds like a much more realistic approach.  It’s less about a quick fix and more about a long-term shift in the research culture.  It's encouraging to hear that there's a community actively tackling this.  So, where does this leave researchers who need reliable antibodies *now*?  What advice would you give them?

Joe:  Well, there’s no magic bullet.  But using resources like CiteAb, carefully checking for validation data, and prioritizing antibodies with RRIDs are good first steps.  Being aware of the limitations and potential pitfalls is also crucial.  It's about being critical and skeptical of the data you're using.  You know,  doing your homework.

Sarah:  Excellent advice.  It’s all about critical thinking and due diligence.  Thanks Joe, this has been incredibly informative.  I think we've cleared up a lot of misconceptions about antibody reliability.  And that's a wrap for this week's…

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Okay, Joe, that was a lot of information about antibody reliability.  One thing that stood out was the shift towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounded like a big deal.

Joe: Yeah, it is a pretty big deal.  Essentially, older methods of antibody production relied on using immune cells, you know, the cells in your body that fight off infections.  These cells would produce antibodies, but the process was… inconsistent.  Different batches of antibodies produced this way could vary significantly in their quality and effectiveness.

Sarah:  So, like, you'd get a slightly different product each time?  Kind of like baking a cake without a precise recipe?

Joe:  Hmm, that's not a bad analogy, actually.  Though, it's more like trying to get the same batch of yeast every time, and the yeast itself is slightly different each time.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are made using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce a specific antibody, so you get a much more consistent and reliable product.  The process is much more standardized.

Sarah:  Ah, so it's like having a precise recipe for the antibody, ensuring consistent results. That makes a lot of sense.  But why was this such a big problem before?  I mean, what were the consequences of having inconsistent antibodies?

Joe: Well, inconsistent antibodies lead to irreproducible research.  If a scientist uses a batch of antibodies that are slightly different than the antibodies used in another lab, you might get different results, even if you're doing the exact same experiment.  That makes it incredibly difficult to verify findings, leading to a lot of wasted time and resources.

Sarah: That's frustrating.  So, essentially, this shift towards recombinant antibodies is a big step towards making research more reliable?

Joe: Exactly.  It's a crucial step in improving reproducibility.  And it's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about the entire process of producing and using them.  The movement towards standardized production methods is a huge benefit.

Sarah:  So, even though there's still work to be done on changing scientists' behavior and getting everyone to adopt these new methods, the move towards recombinant antibodies is a positive development?

Joe: Absolutely.  It's a significant improvement, and while there are certainly challenges remaining, the overall trend is heading in the right direction.  The increased standardization, coupled with initiatives like the ones mentioned earlier, offers a much brighter outlook for antibody research.  It's a really promising development.


Sarah: This has been incredibly helpful, Joe. Thanks for clarifying all of that. I feel much more confident in understanding the issues and solutions surrounding antibody reliability now.  I think we've covered a lot of ground today.  Thanks for joining me.  And that’s a wrap for this week’s episode of…

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

Sarah: Absolutely. So, before we wrap up, could you just quickly summarize the main ways researchers actually *validate* these antibodies? You mentioned a few, but I'd love a quick recap.

Joe: Sure.  So, there are several key methods.  One is immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  Essentially, you're staining cells to see if the antibody binds specifically to the protein you're interested in.  If it lights up the right cells, that's a good sign.  Then there's Western blotting. This is where you separate proteins by size using electrophoresis, then use the antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  You get a band on the blot if it does.  It's like…well, you're checking for a specific weight signature, I guess.

Sarah:  Okay, so IHC is more of a visual confirmation at the cellular level, and Western blotting is more about confirming the protein's size, right?

Joe: Exactly. And then there's immunoprecipitation. This is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to basically fish out the specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins. Then, you can use techniques like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the protein you've pulled out.  It’s a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  Um… think of it as a more definitive confirmation.

Sarah:  So, it's like three different lines of evidence pointing to the same conclusion: the antibody is specifically binding to the target protein?

Joe:  Precisely.  Using multiple methods gives you much greater confidence in the reliability of your antibody.  You're triangulating, you know?  It's not foolproof, of course, but it significantly reduces the risk of false positives or false negatives.

Sarah:  That makes a lot of sense.  It's all about minimizing errors and increasing confidence in the results, which is crucial for any scientific endeavor.  I think that’s a perfect place to wrap things up.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this "reproducibility crisis" in science.  Is this directly related?  And, um, can you explain what exactly the problem *is* with these antibodies?  I mean, I know they're used to, like, identify proteins and stuff, but...
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a really fascinating – and frankly, slightly frustrating – area of biological research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies and how scientists are trying to fix it.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  The problem is that many commercially available antibodies – the ones scientists buy to use in their research – simply don't work as advertised.  They either don't bind to the target protein they're *supposed* to bind to, or they bind to other things too, giving you false results.  Think of it like… well,  maybe not an analogy, but imagine you're trying to find a specific screw in a toolbox, and your "antibody" is a magnet that sticks to *all* the metal, not just the screw.  It's useless.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, so it's a lack of specificity and selectivity, right?  You mentioned that earlier, I think.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely! Specificity means it only binds to the *one* target protein. Selectivity means it avoids binding to everything else.  And a lot of these antibodies are failing on both counts.  This researcher, Carl Laflamme,  he was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He was trying to figure out where this protein, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, is located within the cell.  He looked at sixteen different commercially available antibodies, supposed to bind to this protein… and only three actually worked properly.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow.  Only three out of sixteen?  That's... a pretty low success rate. So, what happened with the other thirteen?  Did they just not bind at all?  Or did they bind to the wrong things?
[INFO] Joe: Um, yeah, it was a mix.  Some didn't bind at all,  others bound to completely different proteins.  And the crazy thing is,  many of those poorly performing antibodies had been used in published studies –  studies that had been cited thousands of times!  So, you know, a huge amount of research might be based on flawed data.
[INFO] Sarah: That’s… terrifying. So what are scientists doing to tackle this?  Is there a way to improve the quality of these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. There are several initiatives underway.  One is this project called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science – which aims to systematically test *all* commercially available antibodies for human proteins.  Others are focusing on developing better antibody production methods. It’s a huge undertaking, but, you know, it’s really a necessary step to improve the reliability of biological research.  It’s about improving the tools of the trade, essentially.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive project.  I guess it's a good example of how even seemingly small details, like the quality of an antibody, can have huge consequences for the entire field.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's a lot to wrap my head around, but it’s definitely important.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that’s it for this week’s Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we delve into…
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, antibody validation.  The YCharOS initiative, fascinating stuff.  Essentially, they're tackling a huge problem: the reliability of commercially available antibodies.  Millions are on the market, but a significant portion don't perform as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  And that’s the crazy part!  Millions of antibodies, and a large percentage are unreliable.  It makes you wonder how much research is based on flawed data, doesn't it?  What's the core of their methodology?  You mentioned something about cell lines...
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  YCharOS uses a comparative approach.  They test the antibody's specificity in two cell lines: one that expresses the target protein normally, and a "knock-out" line lacking that protein.  This allows them to directly assess whether the antibody binds specifically to the intended target, or if it's exhibiting cross-reactivity – binding to other things unintentionally.  It's a pretty straightforward, but powerful, method.
[INFO] Sarah: So, a kind of "before-and-after" comparison?  Like, if it binds in the normal cell line but not in the knockout, you've got a good indication of specificity?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  It's a direct measure of specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line provides strong evidence that the antibody is actually targeting the intended protein and not something else.  It's a crucial control.  And, uhm...  YCharOS's success lies partly in its collaborative nature.  They've gotten antibody manufacturers on board, which is a huge step.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a significant element.  The fact that they're working with the manufacturers rather than just independently testing is key.  It seems like a much more effective approach to ensuring improvements are made.  I mean, what's the point of identifying a problem if you can’t get the source to address it?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's not just about identifying problems; it's about driving change.  They're not just publishing reports; they're working with the manufacturers to improve the antibodies or remove flawed ones from the market.  That’s a real game changer.
[INFO] Sarah: It’s impressive, really. But even with YCharOS, it's not a perfect solution, right?  You mentioned that the context matters.
[INFO] Joe: Right.  The way an antibody performs can vary depending on the specific application, tissue type, or even the experimental protocol used.  YCharOS focuses on a specific test context, but that doesn't guarantee performance in every situation.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in.  They're tackling validation across different contexts and applications, though their approach is…different.
[INFO] Sarah: So, YCharOS is focused on rigorous testing in a controlled environment, while OMAPs is more about community-based validation across a range of conditions?  A broader, less controlled approach?
[INFO] Joe: Yes,  OMAPs is more of a crowdsourced validation effort.  It utilizes a community of researchers to test antibodies in diverse contexts.  It's a different strategy, aiming for broader applicability, but potentially with less rigorous control over the testing conditions.  It’s a trade-off.
[INFO] Sarah: It's interesting to see these two different approaches, both tackling the same fundamental problem but with different strategies.  It highlights the complexity of antibody validation.  Thanks Joe, this has been incredibly insightful.  I feel much clearer on this now.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it.  And that's a wrap for this week's…
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's a mess, really.  We talked about how hard it is to even *find* the right antibodies, let alone know if they're any good. Remember Anita Bandrowski's work with RRIDs?  That's a huge step forward in just tracking down the specific antibody used in a study.  Before RRIDs,  90% of antibodies cited in some journals lacked catalogue numbers – making replication practically impossible.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, the catalogue numbers.  That makes perfect sense.  But even if you *can* find the antibody, how do you know it's actually going to work as expected?  It sounds like a huge problem, and I’m curious, what's the biggest hurdle to overcome?  Is it the lack of standardization, or something else entirely?
[INFO] Joe: It's a multifaceted problem.  Lack of standardization is a big part of it, absolutely.  But also, the sheer variety in how antibodies are used.  Andrew Chalmers, with CiteAb, highlights this.  There's no single, universally accepted validation method.  Knock-out validation is often cited as the gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have that level of validation.  It's a huge gap.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, less than 5%? That's...sobering.  So,  if knock-out validation is the gold standard, why isn't it more common? Is it just too expensive or time-consuming?
[INFO] Joe: It's both, I think.  It's resource-intensive, requiring specialized techniques and expertise.  Also, the incentive structure isn't always there.  Manufacturers might not prioritize it if there's not a strong market demand for fully validated antibodies.  Plus, many existing antibodies were developed before these rigorous validation methods became standard practice.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's a combination of historical issues and current practical limitations.  That makes sense.  You mentioned the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community. What's their approach?  Are they trying to force standardization or something more collaborative?
[INFO] Joe: OGA is taking a collaborative approach. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers – all the stakeholders – to discuss solutions.  It's about fostering a culture of transparency and better communication.  They’re trying to create a shared understanding of the problem and work towards better practices, rather than imposing strict regulations.  It's a more bottom-up approach, which I think is crucial given the complexity of the issue.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a much more realistic approach.  It’s less about a quick fix and more about a long-term shift in the research culture.  It's encouraging to hear that there's a community actively tackling this.  So, where does this leave researchers who need reliable antibodies *now*?  What advice would you give them?
[INFO] Joe: Well, there’s no magic bullet.  But using resources like CiteAb, carefully checking for validation data, and prioritizing antibodies with RRIDs are good first steps.  Being aware of the limitations and potential pitfalls is also crucial.  It's about being critical and skeptical of the data you're using.  You know,  doing your homework.
[INFO] Sarah: Excellent advice.  It’s all about critical thinking and due diligence.  Thanks Joe, this has been incredibly informative.  I think we've cleared up a lot of misconceptions about antibody reliability.  And that's a wrap for this week's…
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, Joe, that was a lot of information about antibody reliability.  One thing that stood out was the shift towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounded like a big deal.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it is a pretty big deal.  Essentially, older methods of antibody production relied on using immune cells, you know, the cells in your body that fight off infections.  These cells would produce antibodies, but the process was… inconsistent.  Different batches of antibodies produced this way could vary significantly in their quality and effectiveness.
[INFO] Sarah: So, like, you'd get a slightly different product each time?  Kind of like baking a cake without a precise recipe?
[INFO] Joe: Hmm, that's not a bad analogy, actually.  Though, it's more like trying to get the same batch of yeast every time, and the yeast itself is slightly different each time.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are made using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce a specific antibody, so you get a much more consistent and reliable product.  The process is much more standardized.
[INFO] Sarah: Ah, so it's like having a precise recipe for the antibody, ensuring consistent results. That makes a lot of sense.  But why was this such a big problem before?  I mean, what were the consequences of having inconsistent antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Well, inconsistent antibodies lead to irreproducible research.  If a scientist uses a batch of antibodies that are slightly different than the antibodies used in another lab, you might get different results, even if you're doing the exact same experiment.  That makes it incredibly difficult to verify findings, leading to a lot of wasted time and resources.
[INFO] Sarah: That's frustrating.  So, essentially, this shift towards recombinant antibodies is a big step towards making research more reliable?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a crucial step in improving reproducibility.  And it's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about the entire process of producing and using them.  The movement towards standardized production methods is a huge benefit.
[INFO] Sarah: So, even though there's still work to be done on changing scientists' behavior and getting everyone to adopt these new methods, the move towards recombinant antibodies is a positive development?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a significant improvement, and while there are certainly challenges remaining, the overall trend is heading in the right direction.  The increased standardization, coupled with initiatives like the ones mentioned earlier, offers a much brighter outlook for antibody research.  It's a really promising development.
[INFO] Sarah: This has been incredibly helpful, Joe. Thanks for clarifying all of that. I feel much more confident in understanding the issues and solutions surrounding antibody reliability now.  I think we've covered a lot of ground today.  Thanks for joining me.  And that’s a wrap for this week’s episode of…
