**Joe:** Welcome back to Science Unfiltered! We're continuing our deep dive into the YCharOS initiative, a project dedicated to improving the reliability of research antibodies. In our previous segment, we discussed the rigorous testing process YCharOS utilizes to ensure antibody specificity and performance. Today, we'll shift our focus to the broader challenges associated with choosing and using research antibodies, delving into the efforts being made to tackle these issues.

**Sarah:** That's right, Joe. As we heard earlier, simply knowing which antibodies work well is only part of the equation. Researchers need a way to navigate the vast landscape of available antibodies and select the most appropriate ones for their specific needs. This is where platforms like CiteAb come into play.

**Joe:** Can you tell us more about CiteAb and its role in this process?

**Sarah:** Absolutely. CiteAb is essentially a search engine for research antibodies. It allows researchers to find and compare antibodies based on a variety of criteria, including target protein, species, application, and validation status. It also integrates YCharOS's characterization data, providing researchers with valuable information about antibody performance.

**Joe:** So, CiteAb acts as a centralized hub for antibody information, allowing researchers to make informed decisions about which antibodies to use. But even with this resource, there are still challenges, right?

**Sarah:** Indeed. As mentioned earlier, antibodies are used in countless ways and for diverse applications. It's impossible to simply label an antibody as "good" or "bad" without considering the specific context. Additionally, less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated through knockout experiments, highlighting the need for more rigorous validation procedures.

**Joe:** This is where initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community come into play. Can you tell us more about their efforts?

**Sarah:** The OGA community aims to bring together various stakeholders, including researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers, to tackle the issue of poorly performing antibodies. They're working on several projects, including developing resources to help researchers choose the right antibodies and promoting best practices for antibody use and validation.

**Joe:** It's encouraging to see such a collaborative effort taking shape. And it seems like manufacturers are also playing a role in improving antibody quality.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. Many manufacturers are shifting towards producing recombinant antibodies, which offer greater consistency and reproducibility compared to traditional methods. This shift is crucial for ensuring the reliability of research results.

**Joe:** Well, Sarah, it seems we're witnessing a multi-pronged approach to tackling the challenge of antibody reliability. From rigorous testing and validation to improved search engines and collaborative initiatives, the research community is taking significant steps towards a brighter future for research antibodies.

**Sarah:** Indeed, Joe. It's an exciting time to be involved in this field, and we can all look forward to the positive impact these efforts will have on the overall reliability and reproducibility of scientific research.

**Joe:** Thanks for sharing your insights, Sarah! And to our listeners, stay tuned as we continue to explore the fascinating world of science and its ongoing quest for greater accuracy and reliability.

New content to discuss: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

Create an engaging introduction where Joe welcomes the audience and introduces Sarah, then begin discussing this content:

C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1. Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells. When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7. 7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating.

[INFO] Raw response: ## CiteAb Data Reveals Shifting Trends in Antibody Use

**Joe:** Wow, Sarah, that's fascinating! It seems CiteAb's data offer valuable insights into how researchers' behavior around antibodies is evolving. The significant increase in the use of recombinant antibodies over the past decade is definitely a positive step.

**Sarah:** Absolutely, Joe. This shift towards recombinants highlights a growing awareness of the importance of antibody quality and consistency. Recombinant antibodies offer several advantages, including greater specificity and reduced batch-to-batch variability, which ultimately leads to more reliable research results.

**Joe:** But it's interesting to hear that changing researchers' behavior remains a significant challenge. Even with improved resources and initiatives, some researchers might still be hesitant to adapt their practices.

**Sarah:** That's true. There can be a reluctance to change established protocols, especially if researchers have been using a particular antibody for a long time and are comfortable with it. However, as Diana Kwon's article in Nature points out, clinging to unreliable antibodies can ultimately hinder progress and even lead to misleading results.

**Joe:** So, what are some strategies to overcome this resistance to change?

**Sarah:** I think communication and education are key. Highlighting the benefits of using validated antibodies and showcasing the potential pitfalls of relying on poorly characterized ones can help convince researchers to adopt new practices. Additionally, initiatives like the OGA community can provide valuable resources and support to researchers who are looking to improve their antibody selection and validation processes.

**Joe:** It's encouraging to hear about the younger generation of scientists who are embracing a more collaborative approach to tackling this issue. Their willingness to share knowledge and work together could significantly accelerate progress in this field.

**Sarah:** Indeed, Joe. It seems like we're witnessing a paradigm shift in how researchers view and utilize antibodies. With ongoing efforts to improve antibody quality, combined with a growing awareness of the importance of validation and responsible use, we can be optimistic about the future of reliable research and reproducible results.

[INFO] Raw response: ## The Antibody Revolution: Cleaning Up Research with Better Tools 

**Joe:** Welcome back to the Science Underground, where we dig deep into the fascinating world of scientific research. Today, we're tackling a topic that's been plaguing scientists for decades: the issue of unreliable antibodies. These tiny tools are supposed to help us understand the building blocks of life, but as it turns out, many of them don't work as well as they should. 

Joining me today to discuss this important issue is Dr. Sarah Miller, a leading expert in antibody research. Sarah, thanks for being here. 

**Sarah:** Thanks for having me, Joe. It's exciting to talk about this, because I truly believe we're on the cusp of a major shift in how scientists use and think about antibodies. 

**Joe:** Absolutely. So, let's dive into the problem. What exactly is wrong with so many antibodies? 

**Sarah:** Well, the main issue is that many of them lack both specificity and selectivity. They might bind to the target protein you're interested in, but they also bind to other, unrelated proteins, creating misleading results. This can lead to wasted time, resources, and even published papers with inaccurate findings. 

**Joe:** Wow, that's a big problem. I can see how that could contribute to the reproducibility crisis we're seeing in science. 

**Sarah:** Exactly. It's estimated that up to 50% of preclinical research findings can't be replicated, and unreliable antibodies are definitely part of the blame. 

**Joe:** So, what's being done to address this issue? 

**Sarah:** There are several exciting initiatives underway. One is the Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS) project, which aims to characterize every commercially available antibody for human proteins. This will help researchers make informed choices about which antibodies to use. 

**Joe:** That sounds like a massive undertaking. 

**Sarah:** It is, but it's also incredibly important. YCharOS is already making a big impact, and similar efforts are popping up around the world. 

**Joe:** What about the companies that make these antibodies? Are they doing anything to improve their products? 

**Sarah:** Some are. A few companies are now offering guarantees on the performance of their antibodies, and there's a growing movement towards more rigorous testing and validation. 

**Joe:** That's encouraging. But what about the researchers themselves? What can they do to ensure they're using reliable antibodies? 

**Sarah:** There are a few key things. First, they should do their research and choose antibodies that have been validated by independent sources like YCharOS. Second, they should use proper controls in their experiments to ensure that the antibodies are actually binding to the target protein. And finally, they should be transparent about the antibodies they use, so that others can reproduce their results. 

**Joe:** Excellent advice. So, Sarah, are you optimistic that we can finally overcome this problem of unreliable antibodies? 

**Sarah:** I am. I think the combination of these new initiatives, improved antibody production, and better practices among researchers will make a huge difference. It's an exciting time to be involved in this field. 

**Joe:** I couldn't agree more. Thanks for sharing your insights, Sarah. 

**Sarah:** My pleasure. 

**Joe:** And to our listeners, we'll be back next week with another episode of the Science Underground. Until then, stay curious!

**Joe:** Welcome back to the Science Underground, where we dig deep into the fascinating world of scientific research. Today, we're tackling a topic that's been plaguing scientists for decades: the issue of unreliable antibodies. These tiny tools are supposed to help us understand the building blocks of life, but as it turns out, many of them don't work as well as they should. 

Joining me today to discuss this important issue is Dr. Sarah Miller, a leading expert in antibody research. Sarah, thanks for being here. 

**Sarah:** Thanks for having me, Joe. It's exciting to talk about this, because I truly believe we're on the cusp of a major shift in how scientists use and think about antibodies. 

**Joe:** Absolutely. So, let's dive into the problem. What exactly is wrong with so many antibodies? 

**Sarah:** Well, the main issue is that many of them lack both specificity and selectivity. They might bind to the target protein you're interested in, but they also bind to other, unrelated proteins, creating misleading results. This can lead to wasted time, resources, and even published papers with inaccurate findings. 

**Joe:** Wow, that's a big problem. I can see how that could contribute to the reproducibility crisis we're seeing in science. 

**Sarah:** Exactly. It's estimated that up to 50% of preclinical research findings can't be replicated, and unreliable antibodies are definitely part of the blame. 

**Joe:** So, what's being done to address this issue? 

**Sarah:** There are several exciting initiatives underway. One is the Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS) project, which aims to characterize every commercially available antibody for human proteins. This will help researchers make informed choices about which antibodies to use. 

**Joe:** That sounds like a massive undertaking. 

**Sarah:** It is, but it's also incredibly important. YCharOS is already making a big impact, and similar efforts are popping up around the world. 

**Joe:** What about the companies that make these antibodies? Are they doing anything to improve their products? 

**Sarah:** Some are. A few companies are now offering guarantees on the performance of their antibodies, and there's a growing movement towards more rigorous testing and validation. 

**Joe:** That's encouraging. But what about the researchers themselves? What can they do to ensure they're using reliable antibodies? 

**Sarah:** There are a few key things. First, they should do their research and choose antibodies that have been validated by independent sources like YCharOS. Second, they should use proper controls in their experiments to ensure that the antibodies are actually binding to the target protein. And finally, they should be transparent about the antibodies they use, so that others can reproduce their results. 

**Joe:** Excellent advice. So, Sarah, are you optimistic that we can finally overcome this problem of unreliable antibodies? 

**Sarah:** I am. I think the combination of these new initiatives, improved antibody production, and better practices among researchers will make a huge difference. It's an exciting time to be involved in this field. 

**Joe:** I couldn't agree more. Thanks for sharing your insights, Sarah. 

**Sarah:** My pleasure. 

**Joe:** And to our listeners, we'll be back next week with another episode of the Science Underground. Until then, stay curious!

New content to discuss: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2. Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1. 6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test. Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says.

[INFO] Raw response: ## Diving Deeper into the Antibody Validation Revolution

**Joe:** Wow, Sarah, that's a fascinating initiative! YCharOS is clearly making a significant impact on improving antibody reliability. But I'm curious, how do they ensure the neutrality and objectivity of their assessments? After all, the industry partners are providing the antibodies for free.

**Sarah:** That's a great question, Joe. YCharOS is very aware of potential bias and has taken several steps to mitigate it. First, the testing process is completely blinded. The scientists conducting the tests don't know which company produced the antibody they're evaluating. Additionally, the data is reviewed by an independent scientific advisory board before being published, ensuring that the results are accurate and unbiased.

**Joe:** That's reassuring to hear. And it sounds like the initiative is already having a tangible impact. It's amazing to think that over half of the underperforming antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, with many being updated or even removed from the market.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. This demonstrates the power of collaboration between academia, industry, and funding agencies. By working together, they're creating a more reliable and trustworthy landscape for antibody research.

**Joe:** But as Cecilia Williams mentioned, there's still the issue of context-dependent performance. Antibodies might work well in one specific application but not in others. How is YCharOS addressing this challenge?

**Sarah:** That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in. By focusing on specific applications and validating antibodies across different tissues and imaging methods, they're providing researchers with more context-specific information about antibody performance. This helps ensure that researchers are choosing the best antibodies for their particular research questions.

**Joe:** It's clear that the scientific community is taking significant steps towards tackling the antibody reliability issue. But as you mentioned earlier, finding the right antibody can still be a challenge. How is SciCrunch's initiative with RRIDs helping researchers navigate this complex landscape?

**Sarah:** RRIDs are essentially unique digital fingerprints for research resources like antibodies. By incorporating them into publications, researchers are making it much easier for others to find and identify the exact antibodies they used. This not only improves reproducibility but also facilitates collaboration and knowledge sharing within the scientific community.

**Joe:** It's amazing to see how these different initiatives are working together to create a more robust and reliable foundation for antibody research. This will undoubtedly lead to more accurate and reproducible scientific findings, ultimately accelerating our understanding of the world around us.

**Sarah:** Absolutely, Joe. The future of antibody research is looking bright thanks to these collaborative efforts. We can expect to see continued improvements in antibody quality, characterization, and accessibility, ultimately paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in various scientific fields.

We can expect to see continued improvements in antibody quality, characterization, and accessibility, ultimately paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in various scientific fields.

New content to discuss: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point. Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies. They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4. Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

**Joe**: Wow, Sarah, that was a lot of information! It's clear that the scientific community is taking the issue of antibody reliability seriously, with initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs making significant strides. But it seems like there's still a long way to go, especially when it comes to choosing the right antibody for specific applications. That's where platforms like CiteAb come in, right?

**Sarah**: Absolutely, Joe. CiteAb acts as a valuable resource for researchers, providing a searchable database of over 7 million antibodies. They even incorporate validation data from initiatives like YCharOS, making it even easier for researchers to find reliable antibodies for their work.

**Joe**: That's fantastic! It's like having a personal antibody advisor at your fingertips. But even with CiteAb's extensive database, there's still the challenge of context-dependent performance, as you mentioned earlier. This is where Andrew Chalmers and his team at OGA are making a big difference.

**Sarah**: Exactly. OGA brings together researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. Their focus on stakeholder collaboration is crucial for driving positive change across the entire research ecosystem.

New content to discuss: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

Bradbury, A. & Plckthun, A. Nature 518, 2729 (2015). WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point. 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

Improved reproducibility, more reliable results, and ultimately, faster scientific progress – these are all compelling reasons to embrace the new era of antibody validation.

**Sarah:** Exactly. And it's not just about individual researchers. As the article highlights, there's a growing sense of community and collaboration among scientists, particularly among younger generations. This collaborative spirit is crucial for driving sustainable change across the entire research ecosystem.

**Joe:** That's really encouraging to hear. It seems like the scientific community is finally starting to take antibody reliability seriously, and that's a positive step towards a more accurate and reproducible future for research.

**Sarah:** Indeed, Joe. And with initiatives like CiteAb, YCharOS, and OGA leading the charge, I'm confident that we'll continue to see significant progress in the years to come.
