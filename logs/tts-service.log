Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.

Sarah:  Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?

Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?

Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?

Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.


Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?

Joe:  Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.


Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

**Previous Context**:
My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.

**Sarah:**  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.

**Joe:**  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.

**Sarah:** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?

**Joe:** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.

**Joe:**  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.

**Sarah:**  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.

**Joe:**  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.

**Sarah:** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?

**Joe:**  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.

**Sarah:**  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?

**Joe:**  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.  

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?

**Joe:** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.

**Sarah:**  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?

**Joe:** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.

**Sarah:**  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?

**Joe:** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.

**Sarah:** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

    "text": "** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers."

** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?

**Sarah:** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?

**Joe:**  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.

**Sarah:**  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?

**Joe:** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?

**Joe:**  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.

**Joe:**  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.

**Sarah:**  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.

**Joe:**  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?

**Joe:** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.

**Sarah:**  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.

**Sarah:** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.

**Joe:** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.


**Sarah:** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.


**Joe:** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.


**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?
[INFO] Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?
[INFO] Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?
[INFO] Joe: **  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?
[INFO] Joe: ** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?
[INFO] Sarah: ** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?
[INFO] Joe: **  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?
[INFO] Joe: ** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.
[INFO] Sarah: ** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of biomedical research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies, which, uh, has been a major headache for scientists for decades.

Sarah:  A headache?  I can imagine.  So, what exactly is the problem?  Is it just that some antibodies don't work as well as others?  Or is it something more systemic?

Joe:  It's more systemic, unfortunately.  Um, you see, scientists use antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  The ideal antibody only binds to *one* particular protein, ignoring everything else.  But, for years, many commercially available antibodies haven't been doing that.  They're either not binding to the target protein at all, or they're binding to other proteins too, giving inaccurate results.

Sarah:  So, false positives, essentially?  And this has been happening for decades?  Wow. That's a huge problem.  How many studies might be affected by this?

Joe:  Exactly, false positives, and sometimes false negatives.  And the scale is... staggering.  One study highlighted how a single antibody, that turned out not to work correctly, was used in over 15 papers, cited over 3,000 times.  Think about the implications of that.  Years of research, potentially millions of dollars, all based on flawed data.

Sarah:  That's... alarming.  So, what's being done about it?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies that sell these antibodies?

Joe:  It's more than that. It's a multi-pronged approach.  One major initiative is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  Their goal is to rigorously test commercially available antibodies for every human protein. It's a huge undertaking, but it's essential for cleaning up the field.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production techniques, making them more reliable and specific.  And, of course, there's a push for better practices within the scientific community—more rigorous testing before publishing results that rely on these antibodies.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of better technology, better quality control, and better practices.  That makes sense.  But, I mean, how can we ever really be sure we've identified *all* the problematic antibodies?  It seems like a never-ending task.

Joe:  Yeah, it's a huge challenge.  And, you know, it's not just about identifying bad antibodies. It's about establishing trust in the data.  This whole situation highlights the importance of open science and data sharing.  The more transparent the process, the better we can identify and correct these errors.  It's a long road, but initiatives like iCharOS are really trying to make a difference.  And frankly,  we need them to. The reproducibility crisis in science is a real issue, and unreliable reagents like these antibodies are a big part of the problem.


Sarah:  Absolutely. Thanks for shedding light on this crucial issue, Joe.  It's a reminder that even the fundamental tools of scientific research aren't always as reliable as we might hope.  This has been a really eye-opening conversation.


Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks again for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.

My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks again for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody validation efforts, particularly YCharOS.  It really highlights a significant problem in research, right?  The sheer number of antibodies on the market, and the surprisingly high failure rate.

**Sarah:**  Exactly, Joe.  It's mind-boggling. Seven point seven *million* antibody products...and a substantial portion don't perform as advertised.  It makes you wonder about the reliability of so much published research, doesn't it?  I mean, what's the impact of using a faulty antibody on the results of a study?

**Joe:**  Huge.  A faulty antibody can lead to completely inaccurate results, wasted time, and resources, and potentially, incorrect conclusions that could impact further research down the line.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – the knock-out cell line, as you mentioned – is pretty straightforward, but effective.  It's a direct way to assess specificity.

**Sarah:**  So, the knock-out cell line acts as a kind of negative control, right?  A way to see if the antibody is binding to something *other* than the intended target?

**Joe:** Precisely.  It's a crucial control.  If the antibody binds to the knock-out cell line, which lacks the target protein, that indicates a lack of specificity – it's binding non-specifically to something else.  That's a major red flag.

**Sarah:**  Makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiative you mentioned, OMAPs?  How does their approach differ?

**Joe:**  OMAPs takes a different tack.  Instead of focusing on rigorous characterization across various applications in a single context like YCharOS, they focus on a *single* application – multiplex imaging – but across *multiple* contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach.

**Sarah:**  So, YCharOS is like a deep dive into the antibody's fundamental performance, while OMAPs is more about validating its performance in specific experimental setups?  Is that a fair summary?

**Joe:**  Yeah, that's a pretty good summary.  YCharOS prioritizes fundamental validation; OMAPs focuses on application-specific validation within a broader range of experimental conditions.  Both approaches are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  You know, it's a collaborative effort, which I think is crucial.  The sheer scale of the problem requires a multifaceted approach.

**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  And the fact that YCharOS has managed to get so many antibody suppliers on board is remarkable.  It speaks to a growing recognition of the need for quality control in this area.  But it also raises a question:  is this level of collaboration sustainable?  Can they maintain this level of cooperation in the long term?

**Joe:** That's a good question, and a critical one for the long-term success of initiatives like YCharOS. Maintaining that level of cooperation and funding will be a significant challenge.  But the potential benefits – improved research reliability, reduced wasted resources – are substantial.  It's a vital area to address.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone!  Today, we’re diving deep into the world of antibodies – specifically, the surprisingly tricky business of finding reliable ones.  Joe, thanks for joining us again.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. It's a fascinating, and frankly, frustrating topic.  We've all been there – spending weeks, sometimes months, chasing down the right antibody, only to discover it doesn't work as advertised.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  I remember reading that study about how difficult it was to even *find* the antibodies mentioned in published papers.  Ninety percent lacked catalogue numbers, right?  That's insane!

**Joe:**  Yeah, it's a huge problem.  That's why initiatives like SciCrunch and the development of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) are so crucial.  Essentially, RRIDs are unique, persistent identifiers for research resources, including antibodies.  Think of them as permanent digital labels that prevent the loss of information when a company discontinues a product or if catalogue numbers are duplicated across different vendors.

**Sarah:** So, it's like a universal product code, but specifically for scientific reagents?

**Joe:**  You could think of it that way,  but more robust.  It's designed to be persistent, even if the vendor changes or the product number changes.  The RRID remains constant, allowing researchers to reliably track down the specific antibody used in a study.  The goal is to make research more reproducible.

**Sarah:**  That makes perfect sense.  But even if you *can* find an antibody using RRIDs, how do you know it's *good*?  That's where things seem to get really messy, isn't it?

**Joe:** That's the million-dollar question, Sarah.  CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that helps researchers find highly cited antibodies.  They're trying to improve things by including validation information when available.  But, and this is a big but,  the validation process itself is complex.  There's no single, universally accepted standard.

**Sarah:** So, what *is* considered good validation?  I mean, what are researchers looking for?

**Joe:** Well, "knock-out" validation is often cited as the gold standard.  It involves showing that the antibody specifically targets the intended protein and doesn't cross-react with other proteins.  But less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have undergone this rigorous validation process.

**Sarah:**  Wow. That's a tiny percentage.  So, what are researchers doing in the meantime?  Just hoping for the best?

**Joe:**  Um, unfortunately, it often feels that way.  There's a lot of trial and error involved.  The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is trying to address this by bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – basically, all the stakeholders – to discuss solutions and improve standards.

**Sarah:**  That sounds like a really important initiative.  It highlights the need for collaboration across the entire research ecosystem, right?  It's not just about one group fixing the problem.

**Joe:** Exactly.  It's a systemic issue, and it requires a systemic solution.  It's a long road, but hopefully, through initiatives like OGA, we can make significant improvements in the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.

**(Outro music fades in)**

**Sarah:**  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey. Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 **(Sound of a gentle transition between segments)**

**Sarah:**  So Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies!  It's fascinating, but honestly, some of it went a little over my head.  Can you break down the key difference between the "old" way of making antibodies and these new "recombinant" ones?

**Joe:** Sure, Sarah.  The main difference boils down to the *production method*.  The older methods involved using immune cells, either directly or hybrids with cancer cells, to produce antibodies.  This process is, um, less precise and leads to batch-to-batch variability.  Essentially, you might get slightly different antibodies each time you make a batch.

**Sarah:**  So like, baking a cake without a recipe? Each one is slightly different?

**Joe:**  I guess you could use that analogy, although the variations are more subtle than a cake. It's more like, you're aiming for a specific protein, and the older methods might sometimes hit the target perfectly, sometimes close, and sometimes, well, miss completely.  The key is the consistency is lacking.

**Sarah:** Okay, I get that.  And the recombinant method fixes that?

**Joe:** Yes. Recombinant antibodies are made using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are *programmed* to produce a specific antibody sequence. It's like having a precise recipe, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.  You get the same antibody, every time, in every batch. This eliminates the batch-to-batch variation that plagued the older methods.

**Sarah:**  So, that's a huge improvement for research, right?  Less variability means more reliable results.

**Joe:** Exactly.  More reliable results mean more reproducible research, which is a massive issue in science. Think about it – if two labs are using different batches of the same antibody and getting different results, it's hard to draw solid conclusions.  Recombinant antibodies help mitigate that.

**Sarah:**  It sounds like a simple solution, but the article mentioned that scientists are still resistant to change. Why is that?

**Joe:** That's a complex issue.  There's inertia, of course. Scientists are used to what they know, and switching to new methods requires effort and potentially retraining.  There's also the issue of sunk costs – if a researcher has already invested significant time and resources using a particular antibody, they might be hesitant to switch, even if there are known issues with it.  Sometimes, they're getting results they're happy with, regardless of the underlying quality of the antibody.  Ultimately,  the responsibility for validation still lies with the researcher.

**Sarah:**  So even with better antibodies, researchers still need to do their due diligence?

**Joe:** Absolutely.  The shift to recombinant antibodies is a huge step forward, but it doesn't eliminate the need for thorough validation.  It just makes the process significantly more reliable and easier to control from the start.

**Sarah:** So, it's less about a complete solution, and more about making the whole process vastly more efficient and reliable.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. That makes a lot more sense now.

**Joe:** You're welcome, Sarah. It's a complex field, but the progress being made is significant.  Hopefully, this conversation helps our listeners understand the importance of antibody quality and the ongoing efforts to improve it.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 (Sound of a gentle microphone adjustment)

**Joe:** So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, validating antibodies.  It's a crucial step, you know?  Because, um, you can't just assume an antibody works as expected.  You need proof.

**Sarah:** Right. And that's what I found a little…daunting in the last segment.  All those methods – immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation… it all sounded quite complicated.  Could you maybe break it down a bit more simply?  For the, uh, less scientifically inclined listener?

**Joe:** Sure.  Okay, so let's start with immunohistochemistry, or IHC. Think of it like this: you have a bunch of cells, right? Some of these cells have a specific protein we're interested in – let's call it "Protein X."  We use an antibody designed to bind specifically to Protein X.  If the antibody works, it will stick to the cells containing Protein X, and we can see them under a microscope.  It's a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:**  So, it's like… highlighting the cells with Protein X?  A visual tag?

**Joe:** Exactly!  A visual tag.  Simple, right? Now, Western blotting is a bit different.  Here, we take a sample of proteins, separate them by size using gel electrophoresis, and then use our antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  It’s like…finding a specific piece in a jigsaw puzzle based on its size.

**Sarah:** Okay, I think I’m getting it.  So IHC is a visual check on cells, and Western blotting is a size-based check on proteins.  What about immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** Immunoprecipitation, or IP, is more about isolating the protein of interest.  We use the antibody as a kind of magnet to pull out Protein X from a complex mixture of proteins. Then, we can further analyze what we've pulled out, often using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  It's a more precise method.

**Sarah:** So,  we're using the antibody to fish out the specific protein we're interested in?  That makes sense.  It sounds like each method offers a different kind of confirmation, reinforcing the reliability of the antibody.

**Joe:** Precisely.  Using multiple methods is key.  It's a bit like having multiple witnesses to confirm a story; it increases the confidence in the results.  No single method is foolproof, but combining them gives us a much more robust validation.  It’s… well, it’s essential for reliable research.

**Sarah:**  That’s a helpful analogy, actually.  So, a combination of these techniques allows researchers to be confident that their antibody is indeed doing what it's supposed to do.  That's… reassuring, I guess.  It sounds like a lot of work though!

**Joe:**  It is!  But it's crucial work.  The reliability of our antibodies directly impacts the reliability of the research findings.  And that, ultimately, affects the development of new treatments and diagnostic tools.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  This has been incredibly enlightening, Joe. Thank you for clarifying all that.

**Joe:** You're welcome, Sarah. It's a complex field, but the progress being made is significant. Hopefully, this conversation helps our listeners understand the importance of antibody quality and the ongoing efforts to improve it.

**Sarah:**  Definitely.  I think our listeners have a much clearer understanding now.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of biomedical research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies, which, uh, has been a major headache for scientists for decades.
[INFO] Sarah: A headache?  I can imagine.  So, what exactly is the problem?  Is it just that some antibodies don't work as well as others?  Or is it something more systemic?
[INFO] Joe: It's more systemic, unfortunately.  Um, you see, scientists use antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  The ideal antibody only binds to *one* particular protein, ignoring everything else.  But, for years, many commercially available antibodies haven't been doing that.  They're either not binding to the target protein at all, or they're binding to other proteins too, giving inaccurate results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, false positives, essentially?  And this has been happening for decades?  Wow. That's a huge problem.  How many studies might be affected by this?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly, false positives, and sometimes false negatives.  And the scale is... staggering.  One study highlighted how a single antibody, that turned out not to work correctly, was used in over 15 papers, cited over 3,000 times.  Think about the implications of that.  Years of research, potentially millions of dollars, all based on flawed data.
[INFO] Sarah: That's... alarming.  So, what's being done about it?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies that sell these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: It's more than that. It's a multi-pronged approach.  One major initiative is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  Their goal is to rigorously test commercially available antibodies for every human protein. It's a huge undertaking, but it's essential for cleaning up the field.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production techniques, making them more reliable and specific.  And, of course, there's a push for better practices within the scientific community—more rigorous testing before publishing results that rely on these antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of better technology, better quality control, and better practices.  That makes sense.  But, I mean, how can we ever really be sure we've identified *all* the problematic antibodies?  It seems like a never-ending task.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a huge challenge.  And, you know, it's not just about identifying bad antibodies. It's about establishing trust in the data.  This whole situation highlights the importance of open science and data sharing.  The more transparent the process, the better we can identify and correct these errors.  It's a long road, but initiatives like iCharOS are really trying to make a difference.  And frankly,  we need them to. The reproducibility crisis in science is a real issue, and unreliable reagents like these antibodies are a big part of the problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for shedding light on this crucial issue, Joe.  It's a reminder that even the fundamental tools of scientific research aren't always as reliable as we might hope.  This has been a really eye-opening conversation.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks again for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody validation efforts, particularly YCharOS.  It really highlights a significant problem in research, right?  The sheer number of antibodies on the market, and the surprisingly high failure rate.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly, Joe.  It's mind-boggling. Seven point seven *million* antibody products...and a substantial portion don't perform as advertised.  It makes you wonder about the reliability of so much published research, doesn't it?  I mean, what's the impact of using a faulty antibody on the results of a study?
[INFO] Joe: **  Huge.  A faulty antibody can lead to completely inaccurate results, wasted time, and resources, and potentially, incorrect conclusions that could impact further research down the line.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – the knock-out cell line, as you mentioned – is pretty straightforward, but effective.  It's a direct way to assess specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, the knock-out cell line acts as a kind of negative control, right?  A way to see if the antibody is binding to something *other* than the intended target?
[INFO] Joe: ** Precisely.  It's a crucial control.  If the antibody binds to the knock-out cell line, which lacks the target protein, that indicates a lack of specificity – it's binding non-specifically to something else.  That's a major red flag.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiative you mentioned, OMAPs?  How does their approach differ?
[INFO] Joe: **  OMAPs takes a different tack.  Instead of focusing on rigorous characterization across various applications in a single context like YCharOS, they focus on a *single* application – multiplex imaging – but across *multiple* contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, YCharOS is like a deep dive into the antibody's fundamental performance, while OMAPs is more about validating its performance in specific experimental setups?  Is that a fair summary?
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, that's a pretty good summary.  YCharOS prioritizes fundamental validation; OMAPs focuses on application-specific validation within a broader range of experimental conditions.  Both approaches are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  You know, it's a collaborative effort, which I think is crucial.  The sheer scale of the problem requires a multifaceted approach.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  And the fact that YCharOS has managed to get so many antibody suppliers on board is remarkable.  It speaks to a growing recognition of the need for quality control in this area.  But it also raises a question:  is this level of collaboration sustainable?  Can they maintain this level of cooperation in the long term?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a good question, and a critical one for the long-term success of initiatives like YCharOS. Maintaining that level of cooperation and funding will be a significant challenge.  But the potential benefits – improved research reliability, reduced wasted resources – are substantial.  It's a vital area to address.
[INFO] Joe: **  And that's all the time we have for today, Sarah. Thanks for joining me.
[INFO] Sarah: ** My pleasure, Joe.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone!  Today, we’re diving deep into the world of antibodies – specifically, the surprisingly tricky business of finding reliable ones.  Joe, thanks for joining us again.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah. It's a fascinating, and frankly, frustrating topic.  We've all been there – spending weeks, sometimes months, chasing down the right antibody, only to discover it doesn't work as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Absolutely.  I remember reading that study about how difficult it was to even *find* the antibodies mentioned in published papers.  Ninety percent lacked catalogue numbers, right?  That's insane!
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, it's a huge problem.  That's why initiatives like SciCrunch and the development of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) are so crucial.  Essentially, RRIDs are unique, persistent identifiers for research resources, including antibodies.  Think of them as permanent digital labels that prevent the loss of information when a company discontinues a product or if catalogue numbers are duplicated across different vendors.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's like a universal product code, but specifically for scientific reagents?
[INFO] Joe: **  You could think of it that way,  but more robust.  It's designed to be persistent, even if the vendor changes or the product number changes.  The RRID remains constant, allowing researchers to reliably track down the specific antibody used in a study.  The goal is to make research more reproducible.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That makes perfect sense.  But even if you *can* find an antibody using RRIDs, how do you know it's *good*?  That's where things seem to get really messy, isn't it?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's the million-dollar question, Sarah.  CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that helps researchers find highly cited antibodies.  They're trying to improve things by including validation information when available.  But, and this is a big but,  the validation process itself is complex.  There's no single, universally accepted standard.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, what *is* considered good validation?  I mean, what are researchers looking for?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, "knock-out" validation is often cited as the gold standard.  It involves showing that the antibody specifically targets the intended protein and doesn't cross-react with other proteins.  But less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have undergone this rigorous validation process.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Wow. That's a tiny percentage.  So, what are researchers doing in the meantime?  Just hoping for the best?
[INFO] Joe: **  Um, unfortunately, it often feels that way.  There's a lot of trial and error involved.  The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is trying to address this by bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – basically, all the stakeholders – to discuss solutions and improve standards.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That sounds like a really important initiative.  It highlights the need for collaboration across the entire research ecosystem, right?  It's not just about one group fixing the problem.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  It's a systemic issue, and it requires a systemic solution.  It's a long road, but hopefully, through initiatives like OGA, we can make significant improvements in the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey. Join us next time for another fascinating journey into the world of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies!  It's fascinating, but honestly, some of it went a little over my head.  Can you break down the key difference between the "old" way of making antibodies and these new "recombinant" ones?
[INFO] Joe: ** Sure, Sarah.  The main difference boils down to the *production method*.  The older methods involved using immune cells, either directly or hybrids with cancer cells, to produce antibodies.  This process is, um, less precise and leads to batch-to-batch variability.  Essentially, you might get slightly different antibodies each time you make a batch.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So like, baking a cake without a recipe? Each one is slightly different?
[INFO] Joe: **  I guess you could use that analogy, although the variations are more subtle than a cake. It's more like, you're aiming for a specific protein, and the older methods might sometimes hit the target perfectly, sometimes close, and sometimes, well, miss completely.  The key is the consistency is lacking.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, I get that.  And the recombinant method fixes that?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes. Recombinant antibodies are made using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are *programmed* to produce a specific antibody sequence. It's like having a precise recipe, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.  You get the same antibody, every time, in every batch. This eliminates the batch-to-batch variation that plagued the older methods.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, that's a huge improvement for research, right?  Less variability means more reliable results.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  More reliable results mean more reproducible research, which is a massive issue in science. Think about it – if two labs are using different batches of the same antibody and getting different results, it's hard to draw solid conclusions.  Recombinant antibodies help mitigate that.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It sounds like a simple solution, but the article mentioned that scientists are still resistant to change. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a complex issue.  There's inertia, of course. Scientists are used to what they know, and switching to new methods requires effort and potentially retraining.  There's also the issue of sunk costs – if a researcher has already invested significant time and resources using a particular antibody, they might be hesitant to switch, even if there are known issues with it.  Sometimes, they're getting results they're happy with, regardless of the underlying quality of the antibody.  Ultimately,  the responsibility for validation still lies with the researcher.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So even with better antibodies, researchers still need to do their due diligence?
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  The shift to recombinant antibodies is a huge step forward, but it doesn't eliminate the need for thorough validation.  It just makes the process significantly more reliable and easier to control from the start.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's less about a complete solution, and more about making the whole process vastly more efficient and reliable.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. That makes a lot more sense now.
[INFO] Joe: ** You're welcome, Sarah. It's a complex field, but the progress being made is significant.  Hopefully, this conversation helps our listeners understand the importance of antibody quality and the ongoing efforts to improve it.
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, validating antibodies.  It's a crucial step, you know?  Because, um, you can't just assume an antibody works as expected.  You need proof.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, pretty frustrating, problem in biomedical research: unreliable antibodies.

Sarah:  Unreliable antibodies?  That sounds… concerning.  I mean, I have a vague idea of what antibodies are, but I'm not sure I understand how they could be unreliable, or why that would be such a big deal.

Joe:  Right, so antibodies are, um, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific things – like viruses or bacteria.  Scientists use them in labs to, you know, identify and measure specific molecules within cells.  Think of them as tiny, highly specific tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies—the ones researchers buy—just don't work as advertised. They might not bind to the intended target protein, or they might bind to lots of other things, giving you completely false results.

Sarah: So, like, a false positive, or a false negative?  Depending on what it's binding to?  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.  A lot of wasted time and money, right?

Joe: Exactly!  A huge waste of resources.  And that's precisely the issue. One researcher, Carl Laflamme,  was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He was trying to figure out where this protein was located within the cell, but he ran into this huge problem.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly designed to bind to this specific protein.  Only three actually worked properly.  And get this –  about fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't even bind* to the protein!  These papers had been cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow.  Thousands of times! That's... staggering.  So, this isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a massive problem that's potentially affecting a huge body of research.  It sounds like it contributes to what people call the reproducibility crisis, right?

Joe: Absolutely.  The reproducibility crisis is a big deal in science. It refers to the difficulty of replicating the results of published studies. And unreliable antibodies are definitely a major contributor.  It means a lot of research, potentially a lot of very important research, might be based on faulty data. It's slowing down progress in drug development and other areas.

Sarah:  So what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?

Joe: There is hope! There are several initiatives underway.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science – or YCharOS.  This group is aiming to systematically test commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards improving the reliability of research.  There are also efforts to create better antibodies and to encourage better practices in choosing and using them.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving antibody vendors, funding agencies, and scientific publishers.  It’s a long-term effort, but there's definitely momentum building to address this issue.

Sarah:  It sounds like a really important problem to solve.  Thanks for explaining it so clearly, Joe.  This is definitely something our listeners should be aware of.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue for the future of biomedical research, and hopefully, initiatives like YCharOS will pave the way for more reliable and reproducible science.

**Previous Context**:
My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue for the future of biomedical research, and hopefully, initiatives like YCharOS will pave the way for more reliable and reproducible science.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe:  So, Sarah, you've laid out a compelling case for initiatives like YCharOS.  The sheer volume of antibodies on the market, coupled with the historical lack of rigorous validation, created a real crisis of reproducibility in research.  It's not just about the number, though, it's also about the *lack of standardization* in how these antibodies are characterized.  Each manufacturer might have its own internal testing protocols, which aren't always transparent or comparable.

Sarah:  Exactly!  And that's where YCharOS’s systematic approach shines, right?  They're not just checking if an antibody *binds* to something, but they're looking at its specificity, comparing performance in cells that *do* and *don't* express the target protein.  That knockout cell line comparison is key, isn't it?  But how exactly does that work on a technical level?  I mean, can you break down the process a bit more?

Joe:  Sure. Um... essentially, they use two cell lines. One, a "wild-type" line, expresses the protein the antibody is supposed to target at normal levels. The other, the "knockout" line, has that gene knocked out – so it doesn't produce the target protein.  They then expose both cell lines to the antibody and measure the binding.  A good, specific antibody should show strong binding in the wild-type line and minimal to no binding in the knockout line.  The difference in binding signals provides a measure of specificity.  It's a pretty straightforward, but powerful, method.

Sarah:  So, it's a direct comparison, eliminating a lot of the guesswork...  It seems almost simple when you put it that way.  But you mentioned earlier that there's still a lot of work to be done, even with this level of rigor.  Why is that?  Is it just the sheer scale of the problem?

Joe:  Yes, the sheer scale is a huge factor. You know, there are millions of antibodies out there.  But also, the context matters.  Even a perfectly characterized antibody might behave differently in different tissues, cell types, or experimental conditions.  YCharOS focuses on a specific, standardized context, but that doesn't guarantee performance in every scenario. Think of it like this...  (brief pause)  Okay, maybe one analogy:  it's like testing a car's engine on a dynamometer.  You get a good measure of its performance under controlled conditions, but it doesn't tell you how it'll handle off-road driving or extreme weather.

Sarah:  That's a helpful analogy, actually. So, initiatives like OMAPs, as you mentioned before, are trying to address that broader context issue by testing in various conditions, right?  It seems like a complementary approach to YCharOS.

Joe:  Precisely. YCharOS provides a solid foundation of standardized characterization, while OMAPs and similar projects build upon that by exploring the performance of validated antibodies in diverse settings.  It's a collaborative effort, really.  Both are crucial for improving the reliability of research.  It's a long road, but we're definitely moving in the right direction.  It's a much-needed step towards more reproducible science.

    "text": "So, Sarah, you've laid out a compelling case for initiatives like YCharOS.  The sheer volume of antibodies on the market, coupled with the historical lack of rigorous validation, created a real crisis of reproducibility in research.  It's not just about the number, though, it's also about the *lack of standardization* in how these antibodies are characterized.  Each manufacturer might have its own internal testing protocols, which aren't always transparent or comparable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "Exactly!  And that's where YCharOS’s systematic approach shines, right?  They're not just checking if an antibody *binds* to something, but they're looking at its specificity, comparing performance in cells that *do* and *don't* express the target protein.  That knockout cell line comparison is key, isn't it?  But how exactly does that work on a technical level?  I mean, can you break down the process a bit more?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Sure. Um... essentially, they use two cell lines. One, a \"wild-type\" line, expresses the protein the antibody is supposed to target at normal levels. The other, the \"knockout\" line, has that gene knocked out – so it doesn't produce the target protein.  They then expose both cell lines to the antibody and measure the binding.  A good, specific antibody should show strong binding in the wild-type line and minimal to no binding in the knockout line.  The difference in binding signals provides a measure of specificity.  It's a pretty straightforward, but powerful, method."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "So, it's a direct comparison, eliminating a lot of the guesswork...  It seems almost simple when you put it that way.  But you mentioned earlier that there's still a lot of work to be done, even with this level of rigor.  Why is that?  Is it just the sheer scale of the problem?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Yes, the sheer scale is a huge factor. You know, there are millions of antibodies out there.  But also, the context matters.  Even a perfectly characterized antibody might behave differently in different tissues, cell types, or experimental conditions.  YCharOS focuses on a specific, standardized context, but that doesn't guarantee performance in every scenario. Think of it like this...

Precisely.

It's a collaborative effort, really.  Both are crucial for improving the reliability of research.  It's a long road, but we're definitely moving in the right direction.  It's a much-needed step towards more reproducible science.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we were talking about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers.  Can you explain that a bit more clearly?  It sounds like a crucial step, but I'm not entirely sure I grasp the full picture.

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  Think of it this way:  researchers often use antibodies, right?  But the specific antibodies they use might not be easily identified later.  Companies might discontinue a product, or the catalog numbers used aren't standardized.  RRIDs are essentially unique, persistent identifiers for these antibodies and other research resources.  They're like permanent digital labels, ensuring researchers can always find the exact antibody used in a study, regardless of whether the company still sells it or if the catalog number changes.  It's a system to track down specific reagents.  It's all about improving reproducibility.

Sarah: Okay, so it's a labeling system for consistency.  That makes sense. But even if you *can* find the antibody, you still need to know if it's actually *good*, right?  That's where things like YCharOS and CiteAb come in, I gather?

Joe: Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but YCharOS and similar projects help you evaluate its *quality*.  YCharOS, for example, provides standardized characterization data for antibodies.  CiteAb is a search engine that aggregates information on antibodies, including, increasingly, validation data from sources like YCharOS.  So you can find an antibody, and then check how well it's been validated through various methods.  It's a two-step process, really.  Finding it and then verifying its quality.

Sarah:  So, YCharOS characterizes, CiteAb aggregates and searches...  It sounds like a lot of different groups are involved.  You mentioned this "Only Good Antibodies" community. What's their role?

Joe:  Yeah, it's a collaborative effort.  The OGA community is trying to bring together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funding bodies, publishers – to tackle this problem holistically.  They're trying to foster better communication and collaboration to improve the standards and practices around antibody use.  They recognize that it's a complex issue requiring a multi-faceted approach.  It's not just about the technology; it's about changing the culture and practices within the research community.  Um...it's a pretty ambitious goal, but you know, a necessary one.


Sarah: It sounds incredibly important.  And it's fascinating to see how many different pieces are involved. It's not just a single solution, it's a whole ecosystem developing around improving antibody reliability.  This whole thing is...well, it's a huge undertaking.

Joe:  It is. And honestly, it's still early days. There's a long way to go before we have a truly reliable system, but the progress is significant.  Even having these databases and communities is a massive step forward compared to where we were just a few years ago.  We're slowly building a more dependable foundation for research.

Even having these databases and communities is a massive step forward compared to where we were just a few years ago.  We're slowly building a more dependable foundation for research.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's a complex issue, but the core problem is simple:  many antibodies, the molecules used in countless biological experiments, just don't perform as expected.  They might not bind to the target protein they're supposed to, leading to unreliable and irreproducible results.

Sarah: Right. And that's why initiatives like the OGA are so crucial, right?  They're trying to improve the whole process, from antibody production to data sharing. But it seems like changing researcher behavior is the biggest hurdle.  I mean, if a scientist is getting results they like, even if those results are potentially flawed, why would they change?

Joe: Exactly.  It's a deeply ingrained habit.  Scientists often develop strong attachments to specific antibodies, even if evidence suggests they aren't ideal.  The shift to recombinant antibodies, which are produced in a controlled, genetically engineered system, is a major step forward.  Think of it this way:  traditional antibody production is like baking a cake with varying ingredients and methods each time. Recombinant production is like using a precise recipe every time, ensuring consistency.  But even with better antibodies, validation remains crucial.

Sarah: So, even with these recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to verify that the antibody is doing what it's supposed to?  That seems like a lot of extra work.

Joe:  Absolutely.  It's a critical step.  No matter how reliable the production method, independent validation is essential to ensure the antibody's specificity and functionality in the specific experimental context.  Think of it as a quality control check on a crucial component.

Sarah: You mentioned data sharing as a key part of the OGA's work.  How does that help?  Wouldn't researchers be hesitant to share potentially negative results about their antibodies?

Joe:  That's a valid concern.  However, open data sharing allows the community to collectively identify problematic antibodies.  It's a bit like crowdsourcing quality control.  By pooling data on antibody performance, researchers can avoid wasting time and resources on unreliable tools.  Plus, incentives like grants for participating in validation initiatives can help encourage participation.

Sarah:  It sounds like a multi-pronged approach is necessary, then.  Better manufacturing, improved data sharing, and changing researcher behavior.  It's a long-term project, isn't it?

Joe:  Indeed.  It's a cultural shift as much as a technological one.  But the progress is encouraging.  The increasing adoption of recombinant antibodies and the growing awareness of the issue are positive signs.  The young generation of scientists, as mentioned in the article, seem to be more collaborative, which is vital for tackling this problem effectively.  It's not just a matter of better technology; it's about building trust and establishing better practices within the scientific community.

Sarah: So, a hopeful outlook, despite the challenges.  Thanks, Joe, for breaking it down for us.

 Sarah: So, a hopeful outlook, despite the challenges. Thanks, Joe, for breaking it down for us.  It sounds like validating these antibodies is… a bit of a process.

Joe: Yeah, it is.  There's no single magic bullet, you know?  Researchers use several methods to make sure they're working with a reliable antibody.  Think of it like this... okay, maybe not *think* of it like this, it's not really like anything else, but...  the goal is to be absolutely certain the antibody only binds to the specific protein they're interested in.

Sarah:  Okay, so what are these methods, specifically?  Because "several methods" is a little vague.

Joe: Right, sorry.  One common method is immunohistochemistry.  Basically, they take a sample of cells, and they apply the antibody. If the antibody is specific to, say, a protein involved in cancer, only the cancer cells – the cells expressing that protein – will show up.  It's like... highlighting the cells with that particular protein.

Sarah: So, it's a visual confirmation?

Joe: Exactly.  A visual confirmation of whether the antibody is binding to the right thing.  Then there's Western blotting. This one's more about identifying the protein by its size.  You run the protein through a gel, and the antibody will bind to the protein if it’s present. You see a band on the gel at a specific spot, corresponding to the protein’s molecular weight.  It's a more quantitative approach.

Sarah:  And how does that differ from immunoprecipitation?

Joe:  Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  Here, the antibody is attached to tiny beads.  You mix these beads with a sample containing lots of different proteins.  The antibody on the beads will grab onto the target protein, pulling it out of the mix. Then, you can analyze what you've pulled out using mass spectrometry, which identifies the protein's exact composition.  It's a more direct way to confirm you've got the right protein.

Sarah: So, you're using different techniques to confirm the same thing – that the antibody is working correctly and specifically?  It sounds like a lot of cross-checking.

Joe:  Precisely.  It's all about minimizing the chance of error.  Science isn't about getting it right the first time, it's about rigorous testing and validation.  And, you know, even with all these methods, there's always a chance of something slipping through.  That's why reproducibility is so crucial.

Sarah:  That makes a lot of sense. So it's not just about one test, but a whole series of checks and balances.  It's a pretty thorough process.

Joe:  Absolutely.  And that's why it takes time and resources, and it's why it's important that researchers are transparent about their methods.  So, yeah, it's a bit of a journey to get reliable antibodies, but essential for reliable research.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, pretty frustrating, problem in biomedical research: unreliable antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Unreliable antibodies?  That sounds… concerning.  I mean, I have a vague idea of what antibodies are, but I'm not sure I understand how they could be unreliable, or why that would be such a big deal.
[INFO] Joe: Right, so antibodies are, um, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific things – like viruses or bacteria.  Scientists use them in labs to, you know, identify and measure specific molecules within cells.  Think of them as tiny, highly specific tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies—the ones researchers buy—just don't work as advertised. They might not bind to the intended target protein, or they might bind to lots of other things, giving you completely false results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, like, a false positive, or a false negative?  Depending on what it's binding to?  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.  A lot of wasted time and money, right?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  A huge waste of resources.  And that's precisely the issue. One researcher, Carl Laflamme,  was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He was trying to figure out where this protein was located within the cell, but he ran into this huge problem.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly designed to bind to this specific protein.  Only three actually worked properly.  And get this –  about fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't even bind* to the protein!  These papers had been cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow.  Thousands of times! That's... staggering.  So, this isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's a massive problem that's potentially affecting a huge body of research.  It sounds like it contributes to what people call the reproducibility crisis, right?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  The reproducibility crisis is a big deal in science. It refers to the difficulty of replicating the results of published studies. And unreliable antibodies are definitely a major contributor.  It means a lot of research, potentially a lot of very important research, might be based on faulty data. It's slowing down progress in drug development and other areas.
[INFO] Sarah: So what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: There is hope! There are several initiatives underway.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science – or YCharOS.  This group is aiming to systematically test commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards improving the reliability of research.  There are also efforts to create better antibodies and to encourage better practices in choosing and using them.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving antibody vendors, funding agencies, and scientific publishers.  It’s a long-term effort, but there's definitely momentum building to address this issue.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a really important problem to solve.  Thanks for explaining it so clearly, Joe.  This is definitely something our listeners should be aware of.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue for the future of biomedical research, and hopefully, initiatives like YCharOS will pave the way for more reliable and reproducible science.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, you've laid out a compelling case for initiatives like YCharOS.  The sheer volume of antibodies on the market, coupled with the historical lack of rigorous validation, created a real crisis of reproducibility in research.  It's not just about the number, though, it's also about the *lack of standardization* in how these antibodies are characterized.  Each manufacturer might have its own internal testing protocols, which aren't always transparent or comparable.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly!  And that's where YCharOS’s systematic approach shines, right?  They're not just checking if an antibody *binds* to something, but they're looking at its specificity, comparing performance in cells that *do* and *don't* express the target protein.  That knockout cell line comparison is key, isn't it?  But how exactly does that work on a technical level?  I mean, can you break down the process a bit more?
[INFO] Joe: Sure. Um... essentially, they use two cell lines. One, a "wild-type" line, expresses the protein the antibody is supposed to target at normal levels. The other, the "knockout" line, has that gene knocked out – so it doesn't produce the target protein.  They then expose both cell lines to the antibody and measure the binding.  A good, specific antibody should show strong binding in the wild-type line and minimal to no binding in the knockout line.  The difference in binding signals provides a measure of specificity.  It's a pretty straightforward, but powerful, method.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a direct comparison, eliminating a lot of the guesswork...  It seems almost simple when you put it that way.  But you mentioned earlier that there's still a lot of work to be done, even with this level of rigor.  Why is that?  Is it just the sheer scale of the problem?
[INFO] Joe: Yes, the sheer scale is a huge factor. You know, there are millions of antibodies out there.  But also, the context matters.  Even a perfectly characterized antibody might behave differently in different tissues, cell types, or experimental conditions.  YCharOS focuses on a specific, standardized context, but that doesn't guarantee performance in every scenario. Think of it like this...  (brief pause)  Okay, maybe one analogy:  it's like testing a car's engine on a dynamometer.  You get a good measure of its performance under controlled conditions, but it doesn't tell you how it'll handle off-road driving or extreme weather.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a helpful analogy, actually. So, initiatives like OMAPs, as you mentioned before, are trying to address that broader context issue by testing in various conditions, right?  It seems like a complementary approach to YCharOS.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely. YCharOS provides a solid foundation of standardized characterization, while OMAPs and similar projects build upon that by exploring the performance of validated antibodies in diverse settings.  It's a collaborative effort, really.  Both are crucial for improving the reliability of research.  It's a long road, but we're definitely moving in the right direction.  It's a much-needed step towards more reproducible science.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we were talking about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers.  Can you explain that a bit more clearly?  It sounds like a crucial step, but I'm not entirely sure I grasp the full picture.
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  Think of it this way:  researchers often use antibodies, right?  But the specific antibodies they use might not be easily identified later.  Companies might discontinue a product, or the catalog numbers used aren't standardized.  RRIDs are essentially unique, persistent identifiers for these antibodies and other research resources.  They're like permanent digital labels, ensuring researchers can always find the exact antibody used in a study, regardless of whether the company still sells it or if the catalog number changes.  It's a system to track down specific reagents.  It's all about improving reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's a labeling system for consistency.  That makes sense. But even if you *can* find the antibody, you still need to know if it's actually *good*, right?  That's where things like YCharOS and CiteAb come in, I gather?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but YCharOS and similar projects help you evaluate its *quality*.  YCharOS, for example, provides standardized characterization data for antibodies.  CiteAb is a search engine that aggregates information on antibodies, including, increasingly, validation data from sources like YCharOS.  So you can find an antibody, and then check how well it's been validated through various methods.  It's a two-step process, really.  Finding it and then verifying its quality.
[INFO] Sarah: So, YCharOS characterizes, CiteAb aggregates and searches...  It sounds like a lot of different groups are involved.  You mentioned this "Only Good Antibodies" community. What's their role?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a collaborative effort.  The OGA community is trying to bring together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funding bodies, publishers – to tackle this problem holistically.  They're trying to foster better communication and collaboration to improve the standards and practices around antibody use.  They recognize that it's a complex issue requiring a multi-faceted approach.  It's not just about the technology; it's about changing the culture and practices within the research community.  Um...it's a pretty ambitious goal, but you know, a necessary one.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds incredibly important.  And it's fascinating to see how many different pieces are involved. It's not just a single solution, it's a whole ecosystem developing around improving antibody reliability.  This whole thing is...well, it's a huge undertaking.
[INFO] Joe: It is. And honestly, it's still early days. There's a long way to go before we have a truly reliable system, but the progress is significant.  Even having these databases and communities is a massive step forward compared to where we were just a few years ago.  We're slowly building a more dependable foundation for research.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's a complex issue, but the core problem is simple:  many antibodies, the molecules used in countless biological experiments, just don't perform as expected.  They might not bind to the target protein they're supposed to, leading to unreliable and irreproducible results.
[INFO] Sarah: Right. And that's why initiatives like the OGA are so crucial, right?  They're trying to improve the whole process, from antibody production to data sharing. But it seems like changing researcher behavior is the biggest hurdle.  I mean, if a scientist is getting results they like, even if those results are potentially flawed, why would they change?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a deeply ingrained habit.  Scientists often develop strong attachments to specific antibodies, even if evidence suggests they aren't ideal.  The shift to recombinant antibodies, which are produced in a controlled, genetically engineered system, is a major step forward.  Think of it this way:  traditional antibody production is like baking a cake with varying ingredients and methods each time. Recombinant production is like using a precise recipe every time, ensuring consistency.  But even with better antibodies, validation remains crucial.
[INFO] Sarah: So, even with these recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to verify that the antibody is doing what it's supposed to?  That seems like a lot of extra work.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a critical step.  No matter how reliable the production method, independent validation is essential to ensure the antibody's specificity and functionality in the specific experimental context.  Think of it as a quality control check on a crucial component.
[INFO] Sarah: You mentioned data sharing as a key part of the OGA's work.  How does that help?  Wouldn't researchers be hesitant to share potentially negative results about their antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: That's a valid concern.  However, open data sharing allows the community to collectively identify problematic antibodies.  It's a bit like crowdsourcing quality control.  By pooling data on antibody performance, researchers can avoid wasting time and resources on unreliable tools.  Plus, incentives like grants for participating in validation initiatives can help encourage participation.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a multi-pronged approach is necessary, then.  Better manufacturing, improved data sharing, and changing researcher behavior.  It's a long-term project, isn't it?
[INFO] Joe: Indeed.  It's a cultural shift as much as a technological one.  But the progress is encouraging.  The increasing adoption of recombinant antibodies and the growing awareness of the issue are positive signs.  The young generation of scientists, as mentioned in the article, seem to be more collaborative, which is vital for tackling this problem effectively.  It's not just a matter of better technology; it's about building trust and establishing better practices within the scientific community.
[INFO] Sarah: So, a hopeful outlook, despite the challenges.  Thanks, Joe, for breaking it down for us.
[INFO] Sarah: So, a hopeful outlook, despite the challenges. Thanks, Joe, for breaking it down for us.  It sounds like validating these antibodies is… a bit of a process.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it is.  There's no single magic bullet, you know?  Researchers use several methods to make sure they're working with a reliable antibody.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of scientific research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies plaguing biomedical research.  You know, it's a bigger deal than you might think.

Sarah:  Oh, I can imagine.  I mean, antibodies are such a fundamental tool in so many experiments. If they're not working properly, that throws everything off, right?  It sounds like a huge problem.  Can you give us a bit more detail about what exactly is going wrong?

Joe:  Absolutely.  Um, the issue is that many commercially available antibodies – the ones scientists buy to use in their experiments – simply don't perform as advertised.  They might not bind specifically to the protein they're supposed to target, or they might bind to other proteins as well, giving you false results.  Take, for example, the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene.  He looked at sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein, and only *three* actually worked properly.

Sarah:  Wow, that's a shockingly low success rate.  So, fifteen out of sixteen were essentially useless?  That's... a lot of wasted time and resources.

Joe:  Exactly! And those fifteen faulty antibodies had been used in studies cited thousands of times!  It's a huge problem because it contributes to what's often called the reproducibility crisis in science.  Scientists repeat experiments and get different results, and a big part of that can be traced back to unreliable reagents like these antibodies.

Sarah:  So, how did this happen? I mean, is it just sloppy manufacturing, or is there something more fundamental going on?

Joe:  It's a complex issue. Part of it is the historical way antibodies were produced.  Traditionally, scientists would inject proteins into animals, like rabbits, to generate an immune response and collect the resulting antibodies.  This is a very variable process. Then there's the issue of testing.  Many companies don't rigorously test their antibodies for specificity and selectivity before selling them.  And, you know, the incentive structure isn't always aligned with producing high-quality reagents.

Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there any hope for a better future for antibody research?

Joe:  There is hope!  There are several initiatives springing up to address the problem. One example is iCharOS,  which aims to characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a huge undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards improving the reliability of these essential research tools.  There's also a push for better testing standards and more transparency from antibody vendors.

Sarah: That sounds incredibly promising.  It almost seems like a whole new level of quality control is needed across the board.  It's remarkable to think that such a fundamental tool in biological research has been so unreliable for so long.

Joe:  Exactly. It's a huge challenge, but with initiatives like iCharOS and a growing awareness of the problem, I am optimistic that we'll see a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of antibodies in the coming years.  It’s a crucial step towards more reliable and reproducible scientific research.

**Previous Context**:
Exactly. It's a huge challenge, but with initiatives like iCharOS and a growing awareness of the problem, I am optimistic that we'll see a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of antibodies in the coming years.  It’s a crucial step towards more reliable and reproducible scientific research.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a really interesting example of how we're trying to address the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's not just about verifying the *manufacturer's* claims, you know? It's about a much more rigorous, standardized testing process.  They're using knockout cell lines, which, as you mentioned, are crucial for determining specificity.  This allows them to compare antibody binding in cells that *do* express the target protein versus those that *don't*.  That direct comparison provides a much clearer picture of whether the antibody is actually targeting what it's supposed to.

Sarah: Right.  But it sounds like even with YCharOS, there's still a lot of uncertainty. I mean, they're testing in a specific context, right?  What about all the other possible applications? Different cell types, different tissues…  how can we be sure an antibody validated by YCharOS will work perfectly in every situation a researcher might use it in?

Joe: That's a really good point.  The context, as you said, is absolutely crucial.  YCharOS provides a strong baseline, a robust verification under specific conditions.  Think of it as a quality control step, not a guarantee of perfect performance across all possible scenarios.  It's like… well, maybe an analogy here helps.  Imagine testing a car engine. YCharOS is like testing it on a dynamometer under controlled conditions.  It tells you a lot, but it doesn't tell you how it'll perform off-road, in extreme temperatures, or with a heavily loaded cargo.

Sarah:  Okay, I get that. So, it's a valuable step, but not a complete solution.  And initiatives like OMAPs are trying to address that broader context issue, by testing across different tissues and methods.  It's a different approach, focusing on a specific application but varying the context. It's a collaborative effort, right?  Researchers from academia and industry working together?

Joe: Exactly. OMAPs takes a more distributed approach, relying on community validation across various labs and conditions.  It's less controlled than YCharOS, but it aims for broader applicability.  Essentially, they're trading the depth of a single, rigorous test for the breadth of testing across many contexts.  It's a trade-off, and both approaches are valuable, offering different strengths.  The key is realizing that neither completely solves the problem, but together they contribute significantly towards improving antibody reliability.  There's still a lot of work to be done, um, you know, to fully address this problem, but these initiatives are showing us a path forward.

Sarah: It's fascinating to see these different strategies emerging to tackle the same problem.  It really highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for multiple approaches.  And the collaborative aspect is key, isn't it?  Getting manufacturers, researchers, and funding agencies all working together... that’s crucial for progress.

Joe: Absolutely.  It’s a complex problem requiring a multi-pronged approach. The level of cooperation is what really sets these initiatives apart, and it gives me hope that we'll see a substantial improvement in the reproducibility of antibody-based research in the years to come.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about the challenges of antibody reproducibility.  It sounds like a real mess!  This RRID system… it seems like a crucial first step, right?  But it's not a magic bullet.

Joe: Exactly.  The RRID system, research resource identifiers, is a vital step towards improving things.  Think of it like this: before RRIDs, finding a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack, without even knowing what the needle looks like.  Many antibodies lacked proper catalog numbers, or the numbers changed, making it nearly impossible to track them down. RRIDs provide a persistent, unique identifier, even if the company providing the antibody stops making it or changes their numbering system.  It's a huge improvement in organization.

Sarah: Okay, so we've got better labeling. But you mentioned CiteAb, which sounds like it helps researchers choose *which* antibody to use. How does that work?  It's still a bit of a guessing game, isn't it?

Joe:  Yeah, it's definitely not perfect.  CiteAb is a search engine, essentially.  It aggregates information from millions of antibodies, and importantly, it tries to include validation data where available.  The problem is,  "validation" itself isn't standardized.  There are many different ways to test an antibody, and not all antibodies are validated in the same way.  Even something as seemingly straightforward as knockout validation – showing that the antibody only binds to the intended target when that target is present – is not universally done.  So, while CiteAb helps you find highly cited antibodies, it doesn't guarantee their quality or suitability for your specific application.  It’s a useful tool, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem of inconsistent antibody validation.

Sarah:  So, even with better labeling and a search engine, we're still relying heavily on citation counts, which, you know, aren't always a reliable indicator of quality.  That's a bit unsettling.  This Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community you mentioned – that seems like a more holistic approach?

Joe:  Absolutely. The OGA community is trying to bring together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to address the issue collaboratively.  The problem isn't just with the antibodies themselves; it's with the entire research ecosystem.  Poor validation practices, lack of transparency, and inconsistent reporting all contribute to the issue. OGA aims to encourage better practices across the board.  It's a long-term project, but it's a much-needed initiative. It's about fostering a culture of responsible antibody use and development.

Sarah:  It sounds like a massive undertaking.  And it highlights how interconnected everything is in scientific research.  One small part – the antibody – can have such huge downstream consequences...it's a bit humbling, isn't it?

Joe:  Yeah, it really is.  It shows how even seemingly small details can have a massive impact on the overall reliability and reproducibility of scientific findings.  And that's something that needs to be addressed at every level.

**Previous Context**:
Yeah, it really is.  It shows how even seemingly small details can have a massive impact on the overall reliability and reproducibility of scientific findings.  And that's something that needs to be addressed at every level.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in antibody research, right?  And how a lot of it boils down to the inconsistent quality of antibodies themselves.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is a huge step forward.

Sarah:  Right, because they're produced in a controlled, genetically engineered system, unlike the older methods using hybridoma cells, which are inherently variable, right?  But it seems like even with this shift, convincing researchers to adopt best practices is a major hurdle.  Why is that so difficult?

Joe:  Yeah, that's the million-dollar question.  It's a combination of factors.  Firstly, there's inertia.  Scientists often have established protocols and, you know, they're comfortable with what they're using, even if it's not ideal.  Secondly, there's the time and resource investment required to validate antibodies.  It's extra work, and, um, funding is always tight.

Sarah: So basically, it's easier to stick with what they know, even if it's less reliable?  It's like changing a perfectly good, albeit slightly leaky, faucet, rather than installing a brand new, more efficient one, even if there's money for the replacement.

Joe:  Exactly.  And there's also a lack of readily available, standardized information about antibody quality.  That's why initiatives like the one you mentioned, the OGA community and their database, are so crucial.  They're trying to centralize information, make it easier for researchers to find validated antibodies, and, ultimately, incentivize better practices.

Sarah:  It’s almost like a chicken-and-egg problem, isn't it?  Researchers need reliable data to make informed choices, but the data isn't readily available because researchers aren't prioritizing validation.  And then there's the issue of manufacturers, right?  How are they contributing to this?

Joe:  Absolutely. Manufacturers are playing a key role.  The shift towards producing more recombinant antibodies is a significant improvement.  It allows for greater standardization and reproducibility.  But, um, you know, there's still a lot of older antibodies out there, and some manufacturers may be slow to fully transition.  There's also the issue of profit margins;  developing and validating new antibodies is expensive.

Sarah: It's a multifaceted problem, then.  It's not just about the science; it's also about the economics, the practical challenges of research, and the human element – researchers' habits and preferences.  It sounds like this is more of a systemic problem that requires a multi-pronged approach.

Joe:  Precisely. It requires collaboration between researchers, funding agencies, publishers, and manufacturers.  We need better incentives, more readily available information, and a cultural shift within the research community to prioritize reproducibility.  It's a long game, but the potential benefits are enormous.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 **(Podcast Intro Music fades out)**

**Sarah:** So, Joe, you were just saying that validating antibodies is… complicated.  It sounds like a real bottleneck in research.

**Joe:** Yeah, it is.  Um,  it really is.  And, you know, it's not just one thing. There are multiple ways to validate, and each has its own limitations.  We talked about immunohistochemistry, which, basically, shows you where a protein is located in a tissue sample using a color-coded antibody.  But that's just one piece of the puzzle.

**Sarah:** Right. So, it tells you *where* the protein is, but not necessarily *what* it is, definitively?

**Joe:** Exactly.  You could get a false positive, you know, due to non-specific binding.  That's where Western blotting comes in.  This technique separates proteins by size, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  Think of it like… well, maybe not an analogy, but it's like fishing for a specific sized fish.  If your antibody only catches fish of the right size, it's more likely to be specific.

**Sarah:**  Okay, so size is one criteria, but  what if there are other proteins of similar size?

**Joe:** That's a good point.  That's why you need further validation.  Immunoprecipitation is another method.  It's like using a magnet to fish out only the protein you're interested in.  You bind your antibody to a bead, and then it pulls out the protein.  Then you can use mass spectrometry to identify the protein – getting a precise identification.

**Sarah:** Mass spectrometry… that sounds pretty high-tech.  Could you explain that a bit more simply?

**Joe:**  Sure.  It's a technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.  Basically, it weighs the tiny bits of the protein and identifies it based on its unique weight "fingerprint."  It’s like having a super-precise scale for tiny molecules.

**Sarah:** So, you're saying you need multiple methods to be really sure your antibody is working correctly?  It seems like a lot of work.

**Joe:**  It absolutely is. And that's part of the problem.  It's time-consuming, resource-intensive, and frankly, many researchers cut corners.  That's why we need better incentives for proper validation and more readily available, standardized protocols.

**Sarah:**  So, it's not just about the technology, it's also about the culture of research itself?

**Joe:** Precisely.  It requires collaboration between researchers, funding agencies, publishers, and manufacturers. We need better incentives, more readily available information, and a cultural shift within the research community to prioritize reproducibility. It's a long game, but the potential benefits are enormous.

**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  Thanks for clarifying all of that, Joe.  It's a lot to take in, but it makes a lot more sense now.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but crucial for the reliability of scientific findings.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of scientific research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies plaguing biomedical research.  You know, it's a bigger deal than you might think.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I can imagine.  I mean, antibodies are such a fundamental tool in so many experiments. If they're not working properly, that throws everything off, right?  It sounds like a huge problem.  Can you give us a bit more detail about what exactly is going wrong?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  Um, the issue is that many commercially available antibodies – the ones scientists buy to use in their experiments – simply don't perform as advertised.  They might not bind specifically to the protein they're supposed to target, or they might bind to other proteins as well, giving you false results.  Take, for example, the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene.  He looked at sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein, and only *three* actually worked properly.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a shockingly low success rate.  So, fifteen out of sixteen were essentially useless?  That's... a lot of wasted time and resources.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly! And those fifteen faulty antibodies had been used in studies cited thousands of times!  It's a huge problem because it contributes to what's often called the reproducibility crisis in science.  Scientists repeat experiments and get different results, and a big part of that can be traced back to unreliable reagents like these antibodies.
[INFO] Joe: It's a complex issue. Part of it is the historical way antibodies were produced.  Traditionally, scientists would inject proteins into animals, like rabbits, to generate an immune response and collect the resulting antibodies.  This is a very variable process. Then there's the issue of testing.  Many companies don't rigorously test their antibodies for specificity and selectivity before selling them.  And, you know, the incentive structure isn't always aligned with producing high-quality reagents.
[INFO] Sarah: So, how did this happen? I mean, is it just sloppy manufacturing, or is there something more fundamental going on?
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there any hope for a better future for antibody research?
[INFO] Joe: There is hope!  There are several initiatives springing up to address the problem. One example is iCharOS,  which aims to characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a huge undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards improving the reliability of these essential research tools.  There's also a push for better testing standards and more transparency from antibody vendors.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds incredibly promising.  It almost seems like a whole new level of quality control is needed across the board.  It's remarkable to think that such a fundamental tool in biological research has been so unreliable for so long.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. It's a huge challenge, but with initiatives like iCharOS and a growing awareness of the problem, I am optimistic that we'll see a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of antibodies in the coming years.  It’s a crucial step towards more reliable and reproducible scientific research.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a really interesting example of how we're trying to address the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's not just about verifying the *manufacturer's* claims, you know? It's about a much more rigorous, standardized testing process.  They're using knockout cell lines, which, as you mentioned, are crucial for determining specificity.  This allows them to compare antibody binding in cells that *do* express the target protein versus those that *don't*.  That direct comparison provides a much clearer picture of whether the antibody is actually targeting what it's supposed to.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  But it sounds like even with YCharOS, there's still a lot of uncertainty. I mean, they're testing in a specific context, right?  What about all the other possible applications? Different cell types, different tissues…  how can we be sure an antibody validated by YCharOS will work perfectly in every situation a researcher might use it in?
[INFO] Joe: That's a really good point.  The context, as you said, is absolutely crucial.  YCharOS provides a strong baseline, a robust verification under specific conditions.  Think of it as a quality control step, not a guarantee of perfect performance across all possible scenarios.  It's like… well, maybe an analogy here helps.  Imagine testing a car engine. YCharOS is like testing it on a dynamometer under controlled conditions.  It tells you a lot, but it doesn't tell you how it'll perform off-road, in extreme temperatures, or with a heavily loaded cargo.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, I get that. So, it's a valuable step, but not a complete solution.  And initiatives like OMAPs are trying to address that broader context issue, by testing across different tissues and methods.  It's a different approach, focusing on a specific application but varying the context. It's a collaborative effort, right?  Researchers from academia and industry working together?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. OMAPs takes a more distributed approach, relying on community validation across various labs and conditions.  It's less controlled than YCharOS, but it aims for broader applicability.  Essentially, they're trading the depth of a single, rigorous test for the breadth of testing across many contexts.  It's a trade-off, and both approaches are valuable, offering different strengths.  The key is realizing that neither completely solves the problem, but together they contribute significantly towards improving antibody reliability.  There's still a lot of work to be done, um, you know, to fully address this problem, but these initiatives are showing us a path forward.
[INFO] Sarah: It's fascinating to see these different strategies emerging to tackle the same problem.  It really highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for multiple approaches.  And the collaborative aspect is key, isn't it?  Getting manufacturers, researchers, and funding agencies all working together... that’s crucial for progress.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It’s a complex problem requiring a multi-pronged approach. The level of cooperation is what really sets these initiatives apart, and it gives me hope that we'll see a substantial improvement in the reproducibility of antibody-based research in the years to come.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about the challenges of antibody reproducibility.  It sounds like a real mess!  This RRID system… it seems like a crucial first step, right?  But it's not a magic bullet.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  The RRID system, research resource identifiers, is a vital step towards improving things.  Think of it like this: before RRIDs, finding a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack, without even knowing what the needle looks like.  Many antibodies lacked proper catalog numbers, or the numbers changed, making it nearly impossible to track them down. RRIDs provide a persistent, unique identifier, even if the company providing the antibody stops making it or changes their numbering system.  It's a huge improvement in organization.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so we've got better labeling. But you mentioned CiteAb, which sounds like it helps researchers choose *which* antibody to use. How does that work?  It's still a bit of a guessing game, isn't it?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's definitely not perfect.  CiteAb is a search engine, essentially.  It aggregates information from millions of antibodies, and importantly, it tries to include validation data where available.  The problem is,  "validation" itself isn't standardized.  There are many different ways to test an antibody, and not all antibodies are validated in the same way.  Even something as seemingly straightforward as knockout validation – showing that the antibody only binds to the intended target when that target is present – is not universally done.  So, while CiteAb helps you find highly cited antibodies, it doesn't guarantee their quality or suitability for your specific application.  It’s a useful tool, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem of inconsistent antibody validation.
[INFO] Sarah: So, even with better labeling and a search engine, we're still relying heavily on citation counts, which, you know, aren't always a reliable indicator of quality.  That's a bit unsettling.  This Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community you mentioned – that seems like a more holistic approach?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. The OGA community is trying to bring together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to address the issue collaboratively.  The problem isn't just with the antibodies themselves; it's with the entire research ecosystem.  Poor validation practices, lack of transparency, and inconsistent reporting all contribute to the issue. OGA aims to encourage better practices across the board.  It's a long-term project, but it's a much-needed initiative. It's about fostering a culture of responsible antibody use and development.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  And it highlights how interconnected everything is in scientific research.  One small part – the antibody – can have such huge downstream consequences...it's a bit humbling, isn't it?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it really is.  It shows how even seemingly small details can have a massive impact on the overall reliability and reproducibility of scientific findings.  And that's something that needs to be addressed at every level.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in antibody research, right?  And how a lot of it boils down to the inconsistent quality of antibodies themselves.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is a huge step forward.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, because they're produced in a controlled, genetically engineered system, unlike the older methods using hybridoma cells, which are inherently variable, right?  But it seems like even with this shift, convincing researchers to adopt best practices is a major hurdle.  Why is that so difficult?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's the million-dollar question.  It's a combination of factors.  Firstly, there's inertia.  Scientists often have established protocols and, you know, they're comfortable with what they're using, even if it's not ideal.  Secondly, there's the time and resource investment required to validate antibodies.  It's extra work, and, um, funding is always tight.
[INFO] Sarah: So basically, it's easier to stick with what they know, even if it's less reliable?  It's like changing a perfectly good, albeit slightly leaky, faucet, rather than installing a brand new, more efficient one, even if there's money for the replacement.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  And there's also a lack of readily available, standardized information about antibody quality.  That's why initiatives like the one you mentioned, the OGA community and their database, are so crucial.  They're trying to centralize information, make it easier for researchers to find validated antibodies, and, ultimately, incentivize better practices.
[INFO] Sarah: It’s almost like a chicken-and-egg problem, isn't it?  Researchers need reliable data to make informed choices, but the data isn't readily available because researchers aren't prioritizing validation.  And then there's the issue of manufacturers, right?  How are they contributing to this?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. Manufacturers are playing a key role.  The shift towards producing more recombinant antibodies is a significant improvement.  It allows for greater standardization and reproducibility.  But, um, you know, there's still a lot of older antibodies out there, and some manufacturers may be slow to fully transition.  There's also the issue of profit margins;  developing and validating new antibodies is expensive.
[INFO] Sarah: It's a multifaceted problem, then.  It's not just about the science; it's also about the economics, the practical challenges of research, and the human element – researchers' habits and preferences.  It sounds like this is more of a systemic problem that requires a multi-pronged approach.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely. It requires collaboration between researchers, funding agencies, publishers, and manufacturers.  We need better incentives, more readily available information, and a cultural shift within the research community to prioritize reproducibility.  It's a long game, but the potential benefits are enormous.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, you were just saying that validating antibodies is… complicated.  It sounds like a real bottleneck in research.
[INFO] Joe: ** Yeah, it is.  Um,  it really is.  And, you know, it's not just one thing. There are multiple ways to validate, and each has its own limitations.  We talked about immunohistochemistry, which, basically, shows you where a protein is located in a tissue sample using a color-coded antibody.  But that's just one piece of the puzzle.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Right. So, it tells you *where* the protein is, but not necessarily *what* it is, definitively?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  You could get a false positive, you know, due to non-specific binding.  That's where Western blotting comes in.  This technique separates proteins by size, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  Think of it like… well, maybe not an analogy, but it's like fishing for a specific sized fish.  If your antibody only catches fish of the right size, it's more likely to be specific.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, so size is one criteria, but  what if there are other proteins of similar size?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a good point.  That's why you need further validation.  Immunoprecipitation is another method.  It's like using a magnet to fish out only the protein you're interested in.  You bind your antibody to a bead, and then it pulls out the protein.  Then you can use mass spectrometry to identify the protein – getting a precise identification.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Mass spectrometry… that sounds pretty high-tech.  Could you explain that a bit more simply?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  It's a technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions.  Basically, it weighs the tiny bits of the protein and identifies it based on its unique weight "fingerprint."  It’s like having a super-precise scale for tiny molecules.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, you're saying you need multiple methods to be really sure your antibody is working correctly?  It seems like a lot of work.
[INFO] Joe: **  It absolutely is. And that's part of the problem.  It's time-consuming, resource-intensive, and frankly, many researchers cut corners.  That's why we need better incentives for proper validation and more readily available, standardized protocols.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's not just about the technology, it's also about the culture of research itself?
[INFO] Joe: ** Precisely.  It requires collaboration between researchers, funding agencies, publishers, and manufacturers. We need better incentives, more readily available information, and a cultural shift within the research community to prioritize reproducibility. It's a long game, but the potential benefits are enormous.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  Thanks for clarifying all of that, Joe.  It's a lot to take in, but it makes a lot more sense now.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but crucial for the reliability of scientific findings.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating, area of scientific research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies plaguing biomedical research.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  I mean, it's a huge problem if researchers can't trust their reagents.  So, what's the core issue here? Is it just a matter of bad quality control from the companies that sell them?

Joe:  Um, it's more complicated than just bad quality control, though that's certainly part of it.  The problem is that, for a long time, scientists have relied on commercially available antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins in cells.  But many of these antibodies simply don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein at all, or they might bind to other proteins as well, giving you completely false results.

Sarah:  So, false positives, essentially?  Or even false negatives, if they don't bind at all?

Joe: Exactly.  And this is where the story of Carl Laflamme comes in. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene. He wanted to know where this protein was located within the cell, but... he couldn't find consistent data in the literature.  He started looking at the antibodies researchers were using, and found that many simply weren't binding to the right protein. He tested sixteen commercial antibodies, and only three actually performed well.  And, get this, none of the papers that had used the poorly performing antibodies actually used the ones that worked correctly.

Sarah: Wow. So, thousands of citations based on faulty data? That's... concerning, to say the least.  It really highlights the potential for cascading errors, doesn't it? One bad antibody leading to a whole series of inaccurate studies.

Joe: Absolutely.  And, you know, Laflamme's experience isn't unique.  It's a widespread problem.  This has, unfortunately, contributed to the reproducibility crisis, making it harder to trust research findings and slowing down scientific progress, especially in drug development.  It's a massive waste of time and resources.

Sarah: So, what's being done to address this?  Is there a way to actually improve the reliability of these antibodies?

Joe:  There are several initiatives underway.  One example is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  The goal is to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  They're essentially creating a massive database to help researchers choose reliable antibodies.  There's also a push to develop better antibodies, to improve production methods, and to encourage better practices among researchers when selecting and using them. It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah:  It sounds like a huge undertaking.  But it's clearly necessary.  It's almost like the scientific community needs a kind of antibody quality control certification process, right?  Something to ensure accuracy and reliability before these reagents even hit the market.

Joe:  Exactly.  It's a huge undertaking, but hopefully, these efforts will lead to more reliable research and ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.  It's a long-term battle, but there’s a growing sense of optimism that we can finally start addressing this pervasive problem.

Exactly.  It's a huge undertaking, but hopefully, these efforts will lead to more reliable research and ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.  It's a long-term battle, but there’s a growing sense of optimism that we can finally start addressing this pervasive problem.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe:  So, Sarah, the YCharOS project is a fascinating example of large-scale antibody validation, right?  It's...um...essentially tackling the problem of unreliable antibodies head-on.  They're focusing on a standardized, rigorous testing protocol using knockout cell lines – you know, cells where the target protein is absent – to compare against cells expressing the protein at normal levels.  This directly assesses specificity.

Sarah:  Right.  But  it's not just the methodology, is it?  The scale of collaboration is incredible.  Hundreds of antibodies tested, dozens of companies involved.  That's what truly sets YCharOS apart, isn't it?  It's not just one lab doing this.

Joe: Exactly.  The collaborative aspect is key.  Having multiple vendors contribute antibodies for testing, and then sharing the results openly… that's a huge step forward.  It overcomes the inherent limitations of individual labs trying to validate everything themselves.  You know, the sheer number of antibodies out there is staggering.

Sarah:  Seven point seven million, if I remember correctly.  That's...wow.  But even with YCharOS's impressive scale, it still feels like a drop in the ocean.  And as Cecilia Williams pointed out, the context matters.  An antibody might work perfectly in one cell type, one assay, but fail miserably in another.  How do we address that broader challenge?

Joe: That's a really good point.  YCharOS focuses on a specific, standardized testing protocol.  It's a crucial first step, providing a baseline of reliable information.  But you’re right,  the context-dependent nature of antibody performance remains a significant hurdle.  Initiatives like OMAPs, which focus on validating antibodies across different tissues and imaging methods for a specific application, are trying to tackle that.  It's a multi-faceted problem requiring different approaches.

Sarah: So, OMAPs takes a more distributed, community-driven approach, right?  Researchers from various labs test the antibodies in their own specific contexts.  It's almost like a crowdsourced validation effort.

Joe:  Precisely.  It leverages the diverse expertise and experimental setups within the research community.  The trade-off is a less standardized approach compared to YCharOS, but it gains a much broader perspective on antibody performance across different conditions.

Sarah: It's a fascinating contrast.  YCharOS prioritizes standardization for broad applicability, while OMAPs prioritizes contextual validation for a specific application.  Both seem necessary, wouldn’t you say?  Like two sides of the same coin?

Joe:  I think that's a very apt analogy, Sarah.  They're complementary approaches addressing different aspects of the same fundamental problem: ensuring reliable antibody performance in research.  And both highlight the need for greater collaboration and transparency within the field.  It's...it’s a long road, but these initiatives are definitely paving the way for more reliable biomedical research.

I think that's a very apt analogy, Sarah.  They're complementary approaches addressing different aspects of the same fundamental problem: ensuring reliable antibody performance in research.  And both highlight the need for greater collaboration and transparency within the field.  It's...it’s a long road, but these initiatives are definitely paving the way for more reliable biomedical research.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we were talking about the reliability of antibodies in research. You mentioned these initiatives, RRIDs and CiteAb, aimed at improving things.  Can you explain how they actually work in practice?  I'm still a bit hazy on the details.

Joe:  Sure.  So RRIDs, or Research Resource Identifiers, are basically unique, persistent digital labels for research resources – things like antibodies, cell lines, even model organisms.  Think of them as permanent, unchanging product codes.  Before RRIDs, if a company stopped making a specific antibody, the code they used might vanish, making it impossible to replicate the original research.  RRIDs solve that.  They're persistent, even if the company goes under or changes their labeling system.  It's a simple but crucial step towards reproducibility.

Sarah:  Okay, so that's about tracking down the *specific* antibody used in a study.  But how does that help with knowing if the antibody is *good*?  That's the bigger problem, right?

Joe: Right. That’s where CiteAb comes in.  It's a search engine specifically for antibodies.  It gathers information from various sources, including citation counts, which gives you an idea of how widely used an antibody is.  And increasingly, it's including validation data – essentially, information about whether the antibody actually works as advertised.  It doesn't guarantee perfection, but it provides a much better starting point than just blindly picking an antibody from a catalogue.  It's like… um… you know, having a Yelp review for antibodies, but instead of restaurants, it's research reagents.

Sarah:  A Yelp for antibodies, I like that!  But you mentioned validation data is still limited.  What are the key challenges in actually validating these antibodies?

Joe:  Yeah, that's the huge hurdle.  Antibodies are used in so many different contexts – different species, different tissues, different experimental setups.  What works perfectly for one application might be completely useless for another.  There's no single, universally accepted validation method.  Knock-out validation, where you genetically remove the target protein and show the antibody no longer detects anything, is considered gold standard, but it's incredibly labor-intensive and not always feasible.  So, a lot of antibodies are used without that level of rigorous validation.  It's a complex problem with no easy fix.  It's... you know… a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation.  Researchers need validated antibodies to do good research, but the lack of validated antibodies makes it harder to do the validation work itself.

Sarah:  So, it sounds like these initiatives – RRIDs and CiteAb – are important steps, but they're only part of the solution.  And the validation piece is the really tough nut to crack.  Is that why initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community exist?

Joe: Exactly.  OGA is trying to bring together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to collaboratively tackle this problem.  It's a much more holistic approach, recognizing that improving antibody reliability requires a coordinated effort across the entire research ecosystem.  It's a long-term project, but I think it shows a real shift towards greater transparency and collaboration in the field.  It's... it's promising, at least.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, we were talking about the Open Antibody Group, OGA, and their efforts to improve antibody reliability.  It's a huge undertaking, right?  The core issue is reproducibility – getting consistent results from experiment to experiment, using the same antibody.

Sarah: Exactly. And it’s not just about the antibodies themselves, is it?  It's about the whole process, from manufacturing to how researchers actually use them in their work.  This whole shift towards recombinant antibodies...can you explain that a bit more?  Why are they considered better?

Joe: Right.  Traditional antibody production methods, using immune cells, often lead to batch-to-batch variability.  Each batch might have slightly different antibody properties. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in genetically engineered cells. This means you can program the cells to make a *specific* antibody, and because you're controlling the production process at a genetic level, you get much greater consistency. Think of it like...well, forget analogies, it's just more precise manufacturing.  You're controlling the recipe, so to speak, at a fundamental level.

Sarah: So, less variability means more reliable results. That makes perfect sense.  But even with these improvements, it seems like changing researcher behavior is a major hurdle.  The article mentioned some researchers continuing to use antibodies even if they know they're not ideal. Why is that?

Joe: Yeah, that's a significant challenge.  Sometimes, researchers have a workflow established, they've used a particular antibody for years, and they're hesitant to switch, even if there's evidence of better alternatives.  There's also a time and resource cost involved in validating new antibodies.  It's not a quick process.  It's a complex interplay of factors – habit, time constraints, resource limitations, and maybe even a bit of inertia.

Sarah:  It’s almost like a cultural shift is needed within the scientific community.  The article mentioned a "wolf-pack mentality" among younger scientists. What does that mean in this context?

Joe:  Um, I think it refers to a greater willingness among younger researchers to collaborate and share data openly, to collectively tackle the problem of antibody reliability.  It suggests a more community-driven approach, less of a "every scientist for themselves" mentality.  They’re more willing to work together to establish best practices and share their findings.

Sarah:  So, it's not just about the technology, but also about fostering a culture of collaboration and transparency.  That sounds like a really important aspect of the OGA’s work, going beyond just providing the technical solutions.

Joe: Absolutely.  OGA's holistic approach recognizes that addressing this issue requires collaboration across all stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers.  It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.  It's a long game, but hopefully, the changes are already starting to take hold.


Sarah:  It's definitely encouraging to hear about these efforts.  It sounds like a lot of progress is being made, despite the challenges.  Thanks, Joe, for explaining this so clearly.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a fascinating field, and it’s great to see such a concerted effort to improve things.

Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 **(Intro music fades out)**

**Sarah:** So, Joe, you were just explaining the different ways researchers validate their antibodies.  That was… a lot.  Let's rewind a bit. You mentioned immunohistochemistry.  Can you break that down for someone who, uh, you know, barely remembers high school biology?

**Joe:** Sure, Sarah.  Immunohistochemistry – IHC for short – is basically using antibodies to label specific proteins within a tissue sample. Think of it like this: you have a cell, right? And inside that cell are lots of different proteins.  The antibody acts like a tiny, highly specific tag.  If the protein we're interested in is present, the antibody will bind to it.  Then, we use a method to make the antibody visible, so we can see where those proteins are located within the cells.

**Sarah:** Okay, so it’s like… highlighting certain proteins?  So you can literally see where they are?

**Joe:** Exactly.  It’s a visual way to confirm whether a protein is present and where it's located within a tissue sample.  It's a pretty common technique.

**Sarah:**  Right. And then you mentioned Western blotting.  What’s that all about?

**Joe:** Western blotting is different.  It's less about location and more about confirming the presence and size of a specific protein.  We separate proteins by size using gel electrophoresis, kind of like separating different-sized marbles. Then, we transfer those separated proteins onto a membrane.  We then add our antibody; if the antibody binds to the protein, we can detect it.  The size of the protein helps confirm its identity.  We’re looking for a single band at a specific molecular weight.

**Sarah:**  So, we're essentially verifying the size of the protein matches what we expect it to be?  That seems like a crucial step, right? Because if the size is wrong, something is off.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  It's a key part of validation.  Getting a band at the expected molecular weight significantly increases our confidence that the antibody is binding to the right protein.

**Sarah:** And then there's immunoprecipitation…  This sounds complicated.

**Joe:** It is a bit more involved. With immunoprecipitation, we use antibodies attached to tiny beads to fish out a specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins. It's like using a magnet to pull out a specific type of metal from a pile of scrap. Once we've isolated the protein, we can use other techniques, like mass spectrometry, to confirm its identity.  Mass spectrometry essentially weighs the protein, giving us another layer of confirmation.

**Sarah:** Wow, so it’s like a triple-check system? IHC to see where it is, Western blotting to check the size, and immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry for a definitive ID.  That's quite a rigorous process.  It makes me appreciate the level of detail involved in this kind of research.

**Joe:**  Precisely.  It's crucial to ensure we're working with reliable antibodies.  You don't want to build your entire research project on shaky foundations.  These validation methods are vital for ensuring the reliability of the results.

**Sarah:**  I can definitely see that.  Thanks for clarifying all of that, Joe.  This has been incredibly insightful.


**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a fascinating field, and it’s great to see such a concerted effort to improve things.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating, area of scientific research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies plaguing biomedical research.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  I mean, it's a huge problem if researchers can't trust their reagents.  So, what's the core issue here? Is it just a matter of bad quality control from the companies that sell them?
[INFO] Joe: Um, it's more complicated than just bad quality control, though that's certainly part of it.  The problem is that, for a long time, scientists have relied on commercially available antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins in cells.  But many of these antibodies simply don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein at all, or they might bind to other proteins as well, giving you completely false results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, false positives, essentially?  Or even false negatives, if they don't bind at all?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  And this is where the story of Carl Laflamme comes in. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene. He wanted to know where this protein was located within the cell, but... he couldn't find consistent data in the literature.  He started looking at the antibodies researchers were using, and found that many simply weren't binding to the right protein. He tested sixteen commercial antibodies, and only three actually performed well.  And, get this, none of the papers that had used the poorly performing antibodies actually used the ones that worked correctly.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. So, thousands of citations based on faulty data? That's... concerning, to say the least.  It really highlights the potential for cascading errors, doesn't it? One bad antibody leading to a whole series of inaccurate studies.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  And, you know, Laflamme's experience isn't unique.  It's a widespread problem.  This has, unfortunately, contributed to the reproducibility crisis, making it harder to trust research findings and slowing down scientific progress, especially in drug development.  It's a massive waste of time and resources.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to address this?  Is there a way to actually improve the reliability of these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: There are several initiatives underway.  One example is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  The goal is to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  They're essentially creating a massive database to help researchers choose reliable antibodies.  There's also a push to develop better antibodies, to improve production methods, and to encourage better practices among researchers when selecting and using them. It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a huge undertaking.  But it's clearly necessary.  It's almost like the scientific community needs a kind of antibody quality control certification process, right?  Something to ensure accuracy and reliability before these reagents even hit the market.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a huge undertaking, but hopefully, these efforts will lead to more reliable research and ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.  It's a long-term battle, but there’s a growing sense of optimism that we can finally start addressing this pervasive problem.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS project is a fascinating example of large-scale antibody validation, right?  It's...um...essentially tackling the problem of unreliable antibodies head-on.  They're focusing on a standardized, rigorous testing protocol using knockout cell lines – you know, cells where the target protein is absent – to compare against cells expressing the protein at normal levels.  This directly assesses specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  But  it's not just the methodology, is it?  The scale of collaboration is incredible.  Hundreds of antibodies tested, dozens of companies involved.  That's what truly sets YCharOS apart, isn't it?  It's not just one lab doing this.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  The collaborative aspect is key.  Having multiple vendors contribute antibodies for testing, and then sharing the results openly… that's a huge step forward.  It overcomes the inherent limitations of individual labs trying to validate everything themselves.  You know, the sheer number of antibodies out there is staggering.
[INFO] Sarah: Seven point seven million, if I remember correctly.  That's...wow.  But even with YCharOS's impressive scale, it still feels like a drop in the ocean.  And as Cecilia Williams pointed out, the context matters.  An antibody might work perfectly in one cell type, one assay, but fail miserably in another.  How do we address that broader challenge?
[INFO] Joe: That's a really good point.  YCharOS focuses on a specific, standardized testing protocol.  It's a crucial first step, providing a baseline of reliable information.  But you’re right,  the context-dependent nature of antibody performance remains a significant hurdle.  Initiatives like OMAPs, which focus on validating antibodies across different tissues and imaging methods for a specific application, are trying to tackle that.  It's a multi-faceted problem requiring different approaches.
[INFO] Sarah: So, OMAPs takes a more distributed, community-driven approach, right?  Researchers from various labs test the antibodies in their own specific contexts.  It's almost like a crowdsourced validation effort.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  It leverages the diverse expertise and experimental setups within the research community.  The trade-off is a less standardized approach compared to YCharOS, but it gains a much broader perspective on antibody performance across different conditions.
[INFO] Sarah: It's a fascinating contrast.  YCharOS prioritizes standardization for broad applicability, while OMAPs prioritizes contextual validation for a specific application.  Both seem necessary, wouldn’t you say?  Like two sides of the same coin?
[INFO] Joe: I think that's a very apt analogy, Sarah.  They're complementary approaches addressing different aspects of the same fundamental problem: ensuring reliable antibody performance in research.  And both highlight the need for greater collaboration and transparency within the field.  It's...it’s a long road, but these initiatives are definitely paving the way for more reliable biomedical research.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we were talking about the reliability of antibodies in research. You mentioned these initiatives, RRIDs and CiteAb, aimed at improving things.  Can you explain how they actually work in practice?  I'm still a bit hazy on the details.
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So RRIDs, or Research Resource Identifiers, are basically unique, persistent digital labels for research resources – things like antibodies, cell lines, even model organisms.  Think of them as permanent, unchanging product codes.  Before RRIDs, if a company stopped making a specific antibody, the code they used might vanish, making it impossible to replicate the original research.  RRIDs solve that.  They're persistent, even if the company goes under or changes their labeling system.  It's a simple but crucial step towards reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so that's about tracking down the *specific* antibody used in a study.  But how does that help with knowing if the antibody is *good*?  That's the bigger problem, right?
[INFO] Joe: Right. That’s where CiteAb comes in.  It's a search engine specifically for antibodies.  It gathers information from various sources, including citation counts, which gives you an idea of how widely used an antibody is.  And increasingly, it's including validation data – essentially, information about whether the antibody actually works as advertised.  It doesn't guarantee perfection, but it provides a much better starting point than just blindly picking an antibody from a catalogue.  It's like… um… you know, having a Yelp review for antibodies, but instead of restaurants, it's research reagents.
[INFO] Sarah: A Yelp for antibodies, I like that!  But you mentioned validation data is still limited.  What are the key challenges in actually validating these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's the huge hurdle.  Antibodies are used in so many different contexts – different species, different tissues, different experimental setups.  What works perfectly for one application might be completely useless for another.  There's no single, universally accepted validation method.  Knock-out validation, where you genetically remove the target protein and show the antibody no longer detects anything, is considered gold standard, but it's incredibly labor-intensive and not always feasible.  So, a lot of antibodies are used without that level of rigorous validation.  It's a complex problem with no easy fix.  It's... you know… a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation.  Researchers need validated antibodies to do good research, but the lack of validated antibodies makes it harder to do the validation work itself.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it sounds like these initiatives – RRIDs and CiteAb – are important steps, but they're only part of the solution.  And the validation piece is the really tough nut to crack.  Is that why initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community exist?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  OGA is trying to bring together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to collaboratively tackle this problem.  It's a much more holistic approach, recognizing that improving antibody reliability requires a coordinated effort across the entire research ecosystem.  It's a long-term project, but I think it shows a real shift towards greater transparency and collaboration in the field.  It's... it's promising, at least.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, we were talking about the Open Antibody Group, OGA, and their efforts to improve antibody reliability.  It's a huge undertaking, right?  The core issue is reproducibility – getting consistent results from experiment to experiment, using the same antibody.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly. And it’s not just about the antibodies themselves, is it?  It's about the whole process, from manufacturing to how researchers actually use them in their work.  This whole shift towards recombinant antibodies...can you explain that a bit more?  Why are they considered better?
[INFO] Joe: Right.  Traditional antibody production methods, using immune cells, often lead to batch-to-batch variability.  Each batch might have slightly different antibody properties. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in genetically engineered cells. This means you can program the cells to make a *specific* antibody, and because you're controlling the production process at a genetic level, you get much greater consistency. Think of it like...well, forget analogies, it's just more precise manufacturing.  You're controlling the recipe, so to speak, at a fundamental level.
[INFO] Sarah: So, less variability means more reliable results. That makes perfect sense.  But even with these improvements, it seems like changing researcher behavior is a major hurdle.  The article mentioned some researchers continuing to use antibodies even if they know they're not ideal. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's a significant challenge.  Sometimes, researchers have a workflow established, they've used a particular antibody for years, and they're hesitant to switch, even if there's evidence of better alternatives.  There's also a time and resource cost involved in validating new antibodies.  It's not a quick process.  It's a complex interplay of factors – habit, time constraints, resource limitations, and maybe even a bit of inertia.
[INFO] Sarah: It’s almost like a cultural shift is needed within the scientific community.  The article mentioned a "wolf-pack mentality" among younger scientists. What does that mean in this context?
[INFO] Joe: Um, I think it refers to a greater willingness among younger researchers to collaborate and share data openly, to collectively tackle the problem of antibody reliability.  It suggests a more community-driven approach, less of a "every scientist for themselves" mentality.  They’re more willing to work together to establish best practices and share their findings.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not just about the technology, but also about fostering a culture of collaboration and transparency.  That sounds like a really important aspect of the OGA’s work, going beyond just providing the technical solutions.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  OGA's holistic approach recognizes that addressing this issue requires collaboration across all stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers.  It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.  It's a long game, but hopefully, the changes are already starting to take hold.
[INFO] Sarah: It's definitely encouraging to hear about these efforts.  It sounds like a lot of progress is being made, despite the challenges.  Thanks, Joe, for explaining this so clearly.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a fascinating field, and it’s great to see such a concerted effort to improve things.
