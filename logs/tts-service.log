Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, story about antibodies in scientific research.  It's about how a seemingly simple tool – an antibody – can actually throw a huge wrench into the works of a scientific study.

Sarah:  Oh, I'm intrigued already! Antibodies, I mean, they're fundamental to so much biological research, right? I always assumed they were, you know, pretty reliable tools. What went wrong?

Joe:  That's exactly the point!  Um, for decades, scientists have relied on commercially available antibodies to, uh, identify and quantify specific proteins.  The problem is, many of these antibodies just don't work as advertised.  Take the case of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene. He needed an antibody to, you know, find and measure this protein within cells.  But, he found a real mess in the existing literature.

Sarah:  A mess?  How so?

Joe:  Well,  different papers used different antibodies, and they often got different results. Laflamme, he started by testing sixteen commercially available antibodies that claimed to bind to this specific protein. Only *three* actually worked properly—meaning they bound to the target protein and nothing else.  And get this:  none of the papers that got widely cited actually used those three reliable antibodies! One antibody cited in over 3,000 papers didn't even bind to the right protein!

Sarah: Wow. That's...shocking. So, these unreliable antibodies, they're not just a minor inconvenience?

Joe:  No, not at all.  This is a major problem. It wastes time, money, and resources.  It contributes to what some call a reproducibility crisis in biology.  You know, if you can't trust your basic tools, how can you trust the results?  It really slows down scientific progress and drug development.

Sarah:  So, what's being done about it?  Is there a solution on the horizon?

Joe:  There are several initiatives springing up. One is iCharOS,  short for Antibody Characterization through Open Science.  It's aiming to characterize every single commercially available antibody for human proteins.  It's a huge undertaking, but it's a step in the right direction. They're also working on producing better antibodies and making it easier for researchers to find the reliable ones.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah:  It sounds like a Herculean task.  But I guess if it leads to more reliable research, it's definitely worth the effort.  It makes you think about how much we rely on these seemingly simple tools without fully understanding their limitations, right?

Joe: Exactly. It's a reminder that even the most basic tools in science need rigorous testing and validation. And, you know,  open science initiatives like iCharOS are crucial to building trust and improving the reliability of research.  It's a really important story highlighting the need for transparency and validation in scientific research.

**Previous Context**:
Exactly. It's a reminder that even the most basic tools in science need rigorous testing and validation. And, you know,  open science initiatives like iCharOS are crucial to building trust and improving the reliability of research.  It's a really important story highlighting the need for transparency and validation in scientific research.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a fascinating example of how open science and collaborative validation can improve the reliability of research tools.  The sheer number of antibodies on the market – millions – is staggering, and the fact that two-thirds of those tested by YCharOS didn’t perform as advertised… well, that’s a pretty significant problem.

Sarah:  Exactly! It's mind-boggling.  And it really highlights the limitations of relying solely on manufacturer claims, doesn't it?  I mean, they're selling these antibodies, so there's an inherent conflict of interest, right?  YCharOS seems to address that head-on with their independent testing and collaborative approach.  But what exactly *is* their testing methodology?  Could you break that down for me?

Joe: Sure.  Essentially, they compare the antibody's performance in two different cell lines: one expressing the target protein at normal levels, and a "knock-out" line lacking the protein. This allows them to directly assess specificity –  whether the antibody binds *only* to the intended target.  It's a pretty straightforward approach, but incredibly effective in identifying false positives.  The lack of the target protein in the knock-out cell line acts as a very strong negative control.

Sarah:  So, a negative control is basically a way to confirm that the antibody isn't just binding to anything and everything?  Like, a fail-safe to make sure the results aren't spurious?

Joe:  Precisely.  It's a fundamental control in any experiment involving antibodies.  Without it, you risk false positives, leading to inaccurate conclusions.  The scale of YCharOS's effort – testing over a thousand antibodies – is what makes it so impactful.  It's not just about individual labs validating their own antibodies; it's a systematic, large-scale validation effort.

Sarah:  Right.  And that collaborative aspect, with antibody vendors providing samples for free and participating in the review process, seems key to its success.  It's almost a… a collective responsibility, you know?  But you mentioned earlier that even this initiative has limitations.  How so?

Joe:  Well, YCharOS focuses on a specific context – their chosen cell lines and testing methods.  The performance of an antibody can vary depending on the tissue type, the specific experimental protocol, even the concentration used. So, while YCharOS provides crucial validation data in *one* context, it doesn’t guarantee perfect performance in every situation.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in, focusing on validating antibodies across different contexts and applications.

Sarah:  Ah, so it's like… YCharOS provides a solid baseline, but further validation is still necessary depending on the specific research question.  It’s not a one-size-fits-all solution, then.

Joe: Exactly.  It’s a crucial step, but not the final word.  It highlights the ongoing need for rigorous validation and the importance of transparency in scientific research.  It’s a testament to the fact that even seemingly simple tools require continuous scrutiny.

Sarah:  It's a really compelling story, Joe.  It shows how even something as seemingly straightforward as validating an antibody can be incredibly complex, and highlights the power of collaborative, open science approaches to tackle these challenges.  Thanks for explaining it so clearly.

**Previous Context**:
It's a really compelling story, Joe.  It shows how even something as seemingly straightforward as validating an antibody can be incredibly complex, and highlights the power of collaborative, open science approaches to tackle these challenges.  Thanks for explaining it so clearly.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, that whole RRID system – it sounds incredibly helpful.  But, you know, it's just one piece of a much larger puzzle, right?  Getting the right antibodies is still a huge hurdle.

Joe:  Exactly.  The RRIDs are a crucial first step.  They solve the problem of finding a specific antibody once you know what you need.  Think of it like this... well, maybe no analogy needed. It's simply a unique identifier, a permanent address for each antibody, so you can always locate it, even if the manufacturer changes or discontinues it.  But knowing *which* antibody you need is a whole different ball game.  That’s where platforms like CiteAb come in.

Sarah:  Right, CiteAb.  So they're essentially a search engine for antibodies?  But you mentioned that even with CiteAb, validation is a major issue.  What exactly is meant by "validation" in this context?

Joe: Yeah, CiteAb helps you find antibodies based on citations, essentially popularity.  But that doesn't guarantee quality.  "Validation" means confirming that an antibody actually does what it's supposed to do – specifically, binding to the target protein and nothing else.  There are different validation methods, but one gold standard is knockout validation.  This involves using a cell line where the target protein is missing; if the antibody doesn't bind in that case, you have strong evidence it's specific.  The problem is, very few antibodies have undergone this rigorous validation.

Sarah:  So, even if an antibody is highly cited, it might be completely useless?  That's pretty alarming.  It makes you wonder how many published findings are based on unreliable antibodies.

Joe:  It's a significant concern, Sarah.  And that's why initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community are so important.  They're bringing together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders – to address this problem collaboratively.  It's not just about the technical aspects of validation, it's also about changing the culture of research, incentivizing better antibody production and validation, and making sure researchers have access to reliable information.

Sarah: Hmm, changing the culture. That sounds like a monumental task.  What kind of changes are we talking about?

Joe:  Well, it involves several things.  For one, funding agencies could prioritize projects that include robust antibody validation.  Publishers could require more stringent validation evidence before publication.  And manufacturers could invest more in rigorous validation processes, making it easier for researchers to find validated antibodies. It's a multifaceted problem requiring a multifaceted solution.  It's not just about fixing a technical issue, it's about systemic change.

Sarah:  It sounds like a long and difficult road ahead, but absolutely crucial.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe. It's really given me a much clearer picture of the challenges involved.  It’s far more complex than I initially realized.

**Previous Context**:
It sounds like a long and difficult road ahead, but absolutely crucial.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe. It's really given me a much clearer picture of the challenges involved.  It’s far more complex than I initially realized.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Wow, that's a lot to unpack. So, Joe, let's focus on this shift towards recombinant antibodies.  You mentioned it's a key part of improving reproducibility. Can you explain why that is, in simple terms?

Joe:  Right. So, traditionally, many antibodies were generated from immune cells, right?  The process is... well, it's variable. Each batch you produce might have slightly different properties.  Think of it like baking a cake – using the same recipe doesn't guarantee identical cakes every time.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are made using genetically engineered cells. These cells are programmed to produce *exactly* the same antibody, consistently.  It's like having a machine that precisely replicates the same cake each time.  That consistency is crucial for reproducibility in research.  If you use a different batch of a traditional antibody, your results might vary, even if everything else remains the same.

Sarah:  Okay, I think I get that. So, the consistency of the recombinant antibody production process directly translates to more reliable results in experiments?

Joe: Exactly.  It minimizes the variability introduced by the antibody itself, so you can be more confident that any differences you see in your experiments are due to the actual variables you're studying, not variations in your antibody. Um... it's a significant step forward in terms of reliability.

Sarah:  But it sounds like even with recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to validate them.  Why is that?  Isn't the whole point of the switch to eliminate that need?

Joe:  No, not quite.  The recombinant process ensures consistency *within* a batch of antibodies.  But it doesn't guarantee that the antibody is actually binding to the target it's supposed to be binding to, or that it's functioning as expected. Think of it like this... you have a perfectly replicated cake, but it could still be burnt or have the wrong ingredients, so you still need to check its quality.  Validation is a separate process to ensure the antibody is actually doing what it's designed to do.  It's a quality control check, regardless of how the antibody is produced.

Sarah:  So, it's like a two-step process: consistent production, then careful verification?  That makes sense.  But you mentioned a challenge in changing scientists' behavior.  Why are some researchers hesitant to switch or validate their antibodies?

Joe:  Inertia, mostly.  Some researchers have been using the same antibodies for years, and they're comfortable with them, even if they know they're not ideal.  There's also a time and resource investment involved in validating antibodies and switching to new ones.  It's a disruption to their workflow, you know?  And sometimes, there's a reluctance to admit that their previous work might have been affected by unreliable antibodies. It's human nature, really.

Sarah:  So, it's not just a technical challenge, it's a social and psychological one as well.  It's interesting how these different aspects intertwine.  Thanks for clarifying all this, Joe. It's given me a much better understanding of the complexities involved in this antibody reproducibility issue.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah: So, it's not just a technical challenge, it's a social and psychological one as well. It's interesting how these different aspects intertwine. Thanks for clarifying all this, Joe. It's given me a much better understanding of the complexities involved in this antibody reproducibility issue.

Joe:  Yeah, it's a real mess, isn't it?  I mean, you'd think with all the technology we have, this wouldn't be such a huge problem. But, um...  the reality is that there are so many variables.  Getting reliable results depends on a lot of factors.

Sarah:  Like what, for example?  I mean, you mentioned some validation techniques, but can you break it down a bit more?  What are some of the key things researchers should be looking at?

Joe:  Right. Well,  one of the biggest things is validation.  Researchers need to rigorously validate their antibodies before they use them in any serious experiments.  There are several ways to do this.  For example, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you use the antibody to stain cells and see if it binds to the specific protein you're interested in.  You're looking for a clear signal, you know, where the antibody is only binding to the cells that actually express that protein.

Sarah: Okay, so that's a visual confirmation, right?  You can actually see if the antibody is working.

Joe: Exactly.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a different technique, but it also helps confirm the antibody's specificity.  Essentially, you're separating proteins by size, and then you use the antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size. You’re looking for a single band at the expected molecular weight, indicating that the antibody only binds to that specific protein.  If you get multiple bands, or a band at the wrong size, that's a red flag.

Sarah:  So, you're essentially double-checking with different methods?  That makes sense.  What about immunoprecipitation?  You mentioned that one earlier.

Joe:  Yeah, immunoprecipitation is another way to validate.  It's a bit more complex, but basically, you use the antibody to pull down the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can analyze what you've pulled down using something like mass spectrometry to confirm that you actually have the protein you think you have.  It's a more rigorous way to check specificity.

Sarah: So, it's like, multiple layers of verification to ensure you're not getting false positives or false negatives?  It sounds…labor intensive.

Joe:  It absolutely is. And that's part of the problem. It takes time and resources, and unfortunately, not everyone does it properly, or even at all.  Sometimes, shortcuts are taken, and that's when the reproducibility issues really start to crop up.  And that's where the social and psychological aspects come in, as we discussed earlier.  Pressure to publish, lack of funding...it all plays a role.

Sarah:  It's a fascinating and, frankly, a bit depressing picture you've painted. It highlights just how crucial rigorous validation is, and how easily things can go wrong.  So, what's the takeaway here for researchers?  What's the single most important thing they should be doing?

Joe:  The most important thing?  Thorough validation.  Don't skip steps.  Use multiple methods.  Document everything meticulously.  And, maybe most importantly, be critical of your own work.

Sarah:  Solid advice. Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  Thank you for joining us on this episode of Science Odyssey, where we explored the groundbreaking research shaping our understanding of the world.

[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, story about antibodies in scientific research.  It's about how a seemingly simple tool – an antibody – can actually throw a huge wrench into the works of a scientific study.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I'm intrigued already! Antibodies, I mean, they're fundamental to so much biological research, right? I always assumed they were, you know, pretty reliable tools. What went wrong?
[INFO] Joe: That's exactly the point!  Um, for decades, scientists have relied on commercially available antibodies to, uh, identify and quantify specific proteins.  The problem is, many of these antibodies just don't work as advertised.  Take the case of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene. He needed an antibody to, you know, find and measure this protein within cells.  But, he found a real mess in the existing literature.
[INFO] Sarah: A mess?  How so?
[INFO] Joe: Well,  different papers used different antibodies, and they often got different results. Laflamme, he started by testing sixteen commercially available antibodies that claimed to bind to this specific protein. Only *three* actually worked properly—meaning they bound to the target protein and nothing else.  And get this:  none of the papers that got widely cited actually used those three reliable antibodies! One antibody cited in over 3,000 papers didn't even bind to the right protein!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. That's...shocking. So, these unreliable antibodies, they're not just a minor inconvenience?
[INFO] Joe: No, not at all.  This is a major problem. It wastes time, money, and resources.  It contributes to what some call a reproducibility crisis in biology.  You know, if you can't trust your basic tools, how can you trust the results?  It really slows down scientific progress and drug development.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done about it?  Is there a solution on the horizon?
[INFO] Joe: There are several initiatives springing up. One is iCharOS,  short for Antibody Characterization through Open Science.  It's aiming to characterize every single commercially available antibody for human proteins.  It's a huge undertaking, but it's a step in the right direction. They're also working on producing better antibodies and making it easier for researchers to find the reliable ones.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a Herculean task.  But I guess if it leads to more reliable research, it's definitely worth the effort.  It makes you think about how much we rely on these seemingly simple tools without fully understanding their limitations, right?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. It's a reminder that even the most basic tools in science need rigorous testing and validation. And, you know,  open science initiatives like iCharOS are crucial to building trust and improving the reliability of research.  It's a really important story highlighting the need for transparency and validation in scientific research.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a fascinating example of how open science and collaborative validation can improve the reliability of research tools.  The sheer number of antibodies on the market – millions – is staggering, and the fact that two-thirds of those tested by YCharOS didn’t perform as advertised… well, that’s a pretty significant problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly! It's mind-boggling.  And it really highlights the limitations of relying solely on manufacturer claims, doesn't it?  I mean, they're selling these antibodies, so there's an inherent conflict of interest, right?  YCharOS seems to address that head-on with their independent testing and collaborative approach.  But what exactly *is* their testing methodology?  Could you break that down for me?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Essentially, they compare the antibody's performance in two different cell lines: one expressing the target protein at normal levels, and a "knock-out" line lacking the protein. This allows them to directly assess specificity –  whether the antibody binds *only* to the intended target.  It's a pretty straightforward approach, but incredibly effective in identifying false positives.  The lack of the target protein in the knock-out cell line acts as a very strong negative control.
[INFO] Sarah: So, a negative control is basically a way to confirm that the antibody isn't just binding to anything and everything?  Like, a fail-safe to make sure the results aren't spurious?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  It's a fundamental control in any experiment involving antibodies.  Without it, you risk false positives, leading to inaccurate conclusions.  The scale of YCharOS's effort – testing over a thousand antibodies – is what makes it so impactful.  It's not just about individual labs validating their own antibodies; it's a systematic, large-scale validation effort.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  And that collaborative aspect, with antibody vendors providing samples for free and participating in the review process, seems key to its success.  It's almost a… a collective responsibility, you know?  But you mentioned earlier that even this initiative has limitations.  How so?
[INFO] Joe: Well, YCharOS focuses on a specific context – their chosen cell lines and testing methods.  The performance of an antibody can vary depending on the tissue type, the specific experimental protocol, even the concentration used. So, while YCharOS provides crucial validation data in *one* context, it doesn’t guarantee perfect performance in every situation.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in, focusing on validating antibodies across different contexts and applications.
[INFO] Sarah: Ah, so it's like… YCharOS provides a solid baseline, but further validation is still necessary depending on the specific research question.  It’s not a one-size-fits-all solution, then.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It’s a crucial step, but not the final word.  It highlights the ongoing need for rigorous validation and the importance of transparency in scientific research.  It’s a testament to the fact that even seemingly simple tools require continuous scrutiny.
[INFO] Sarah: It's a really compelling story, Joe.  It shows how even something as seemingly straightforward as validating an antibody can be incredibly complex, and highlights the power of collaborative, open science approaches to tackle these challenges.  Thanks for explaining it so clearly.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, that whole RRID system – it sounds incredibly helpful.  But, you know, it's just one piece of a much larger puzzle, right?  Getting the right antibodies is still a huge hurdle.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  The RRIDs are a crucial first step.  They solve the problem of finding a specific antibody once you know what you need.  Think of it like this... well, maybe no analogy needed. It's simply a unique identifier, a permanent address for each antibody, so you can always locate it, even if the manufacturer changes or discontinues it.  But knowing *which* antibody you need is a whole different ball game.  That’s where platforms like CiteAb come in.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, CiteAb.  So they're essentially a search engine for antibodies?  But you mentioned that even with CiteAb, validation is a major issue.  What exactly is meant by "validation" in this context?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, CiteAb helps you find antibodies based on citations, essentially popularity.  But that doesn't guarantee quality.  "Validation" means confirming that an antibody actually does what it's supposed to do – specifically, binding to the target protein and nothing else.  There are different validation methods, but one gold standard is knockout validation.  This involves using a cell line where the target protein is missing; if the antibody doesn't bind in that case, you have strong evidence it's specific.  The problem is, very few antibodies have undergone this rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: So, even if an antibody is highly cited, it might be completely useless?  That's pretty alarming.  It makes you wonder how many published findings are based on unreliable antibodies.
[INFO] Joe: It's a significant concern, Sarah.  And that's why initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community are so important.  They're bringing together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders – to address this problem collaboratively.  It's not just about the technical aspects of validation, it's also about changing the culture of research, incentivizing better antibody production and validation, and making sure researchers have access to reliable information.
[INFO] Sarah: Hmm, changing the culture. That sounds like a monumental task.  What kind of changes are we talking about?
[INFO] Joe: Well, it involves several things.  For one, funding agencies could prioritize projects that include robust antibody validation.  Publishers could require more stringent validation evidence before publication.  And manufacturers could invest more in rigorous validation processes, making it easier for researchers to find validated antibodies. It's a multifaceted problem requiring a multifaceted solution.  It's not just about fixing a technical issue, it's about systemic change.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a long and difficult road ahead, but absolutely crucial.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe. It's really given me a much clearer picture of the challenges involved.  It’s far more complex than I initially realized.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a lot to unpack. So, Joe, let's focus on this shift towards recombinant antibodies.  You mentioned it's a key part of improving reproducibility. Can you explain why that is, in simple terms?
[INFO] Joe: Right. So, traditionally, many antibodies were generated from immune cells, right?  The process is... well, it's variable. Each batch you produce might have slightly different properties.  Think of it like baking a cake – using the same recipe doesn't guarantee identical cakes every time.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are made using genetically engineered cells. These cells are programmed to produce *exactly* the same antibody, consistently.  It's like having a machine that precisely replicates the same cake each time.  That consistency is crucial for reproducibility in research.  If you use a different batch of a traditional antibody, your results might vary, even if everything else remains the same.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, I think I get that. So, the consistency of the recombinant antibody production process directly translates to more reliable results in experiments?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It minimizes the variability introduced by the antibody itself, so you can be more confident that any differences you see in your experiments are due to the actual variables you're studying, not variations in your antibody. Um... it's a significant step forward in terms of reliability.
[INFO] Sarah: But it sounds like even with recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to validate them.  Why is that?  Isn't the whole point of the switch to eliminate that need?
[INFO] Joe: No, not quite.  The recombinant process ensures consistency *within* a batch of antibodies.  But it doesn't guarantee that the antibody is actually binding to the target it's supposed to be binding to, or that it's functioning as expected. Think of it like this... you have a perfectly replicated cake, but it could still be burnt or have the wrong ingredients, so you still need to check its quality.  Validation is a separate process to ensure the antibody is actually doing what it's designed to do.  It's a quality control check, regardless of how the antibody is produced.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like a two-step process: consistent production, then careful verification?  That makes sense.  But you mentioned a challenge in changing scientists' behavior.  Why are some researchers hesitant to switch or validate their antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Inertia, mostly.  Some researchers have been using the same antibodies for years, and they're comfortable with them, even if they know they're not ideal.  There's also a time and resource investment involved in validating antibodies and switching to new ones.  It's a disruption to their workflow, you know?  And sometimes, there's a reluctance to admit that their previous work might have been affected by unreliable antibodies. It's human nature, really.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not just a technical challenge, it's a social and psychological one as well.  It's interesting how these different aspects intertwine.  Thanks for clarifying all this, Joe. It's given me a much better understanding of the complexities involved in this antibody reproducibility issue.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not just a technical challenge, it's a social and psychological one as well. It's interesting how these different aspects intertwine. Thanks for clarifying all this, Joe. It's given me a much better understanding of the complexities involved in this antibody reproducibility issue.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a real mess, isn't it?  I mean, you'd think with all the technology we have, this wouldn't be such a huge problem. But, um...  the reality is that there are so many variables.  Getting reliable results depends on a lot of factors.
[INFO] Sarah: Like what, for example?  I mean, you mentioned some validation techniques, but can you break it down a bit more?  What are some of the key things researchers should be looking at?
[INFO] Joe: Right. Well,  one of the biggest things is validation.  Researchers need to rigorously validate their antibodies before they use them in any serious experiments.  There are several ways to do this.  For example, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you use the antibody to stain cells and see if it binds to the specific protein you're interested in.  You're looking for a clear signal, you know, where the antibody is only binding to the cells that actually express that protein.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so that's a visual confirmation, right?  You can actually see if the antibody is working.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a different technique, but it also helps confirm the antibody's specificity.  Essentially, you're separating proteins by size, and then you use the antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size. You’re looking for a single band at the expected molecular weight, indicating that the antibody only binds to that specific protein.  If you get multiple bands, or a band at the wrong size, that's a red flag.
[INFO] Sarah: So, you're essentially double-checking with different methods?  That makes sense.  What about immunoprecipitation?  You mentioned that one earlier.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, immunoprecipitation is another way to validate.  It's a bit more complex, but basically, you use the antibody to pull down the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can analyze what you've pulled down using something like mass spectrometry to confirm that you actually have the protein you think you have.  It's a more rigorous way to check specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like, multiple layers of verification to ensure you're not getting false positives or false negatives?  It sounds…labor intensive.
[INFO] Joe: It absolutely is. And that's part of the problem. It takes time and resources, and unfortunately, not everyone does it properly, or even at all.  Sometimes, shortcuts are taken, and that's when the reproducibility issues really start to crop up.  And that's where the social and psychological aspects come in, as we discussed earlier.  Pressure to publish, lack of funding...it all plays a role.
[INFO] Sarah: It's a fascinating and, frankly, a bit depressing picture you've painted. It highlights just how crucial rigorous validation is, and how easily things can go wrong.  So, what's the takeaway here for researchers?  What's the single most important thing they should be doing?
[INFO] Joe: The most important thing?  Thorough validation.  Don't skip steps.  Use multiple methods.  Document everything meticulously.  And, maybe most importantly, be critical of your own work.
[INFO] Sarah: Solid advice. Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful.
