Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Podify, where we explore fascinating topics and stories from around the world. Today, we're diving into the world of scientific research, specifically the challenges scientists face with unreliable antibodies.  It sounds a bit technical, but trust me, it's a really interesting story about how a simple tool can massively impact scientific breakthroughs – or even hold them back.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher studying motor neuron disease, discovered a huge problem: many commercially available antibodies used in labs simply didn't work as advertised.  He was trying to study a specific protein linked to the disease, but the existing antibodies were giving him conflicting and unreliable results.  He tested sixteen different commercial antibodies, and only three actually worked properly!  Fifteen others didn't even bind to the correct protein, and yet studies using these faulty antibodies had been published and cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow, that's shocking! Thousands of citations based on unreliable data? That seems like a huge problem for the whole field of research. How did that happen?  I mean, surely there are checks and balances in place to prevent this kind of thing?

Joe: That's a great question, Sarah.  The problem is that for decades, scientists have relied on these antibodies without always properly testing their quality.  Essentially, they were trusting the companies selling them.  It's a bit like buying a tool from a hardware store and assuming it'll work perfectly, without checking it yourself.  This lack of rigorous testing, coupled with the pressure to publish research quickly, has led to a lot of unreliable data.  It's contributed to what's called a "reproducibility crisis" in science – where other researchers find it difficult to repeat the results of published studies.  This wastes time, money, and ultimately slows down the progress of scientific discovery.

Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope for more reliable research in the future?

Joe: Absolutely!  Scientists are taking action.  Laflamme, for example, teamed up with another researcher to create an initiative called iCharOS – that's Icarus – aimed at characterizing every human protein antibody. This means thoroughly testing every antibody to make sure it's reliable.  There are other efforts too: creating better antibodies, making it easier for researchers to find the good ones, and encouraging better practices within the scientific community. Antibody vendors, funding agencies, and even scientific publishers are getting involved. It's a huge collaborative effort to solve a long-standing problem.  It's a slow process, but there's definitely hope that things will improve.  It's a reminder that even the smallest tools in scientific research need to be rigorously checked to ensure reliable and reproducible results.

It's a reminder that even the smallest tools in scientific research need to be rigorously checked to ensure reliable and reproducible results.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Joe:** Hi everyone, and welcome back to the podcast! Today, Sarah and I are diving back into the world of scientific research, specifically the surprisingly tricky world of antibodies.

**Sarah:**  That's right, Joe. Last time we talked about how crucial antibodies are in research, but also how unreliable some commercially available ones can be.  It's like buying a tool that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't – not very helpful for accurate scientific results!

**Joe:** Exactly!  And that's a HUGE problem.  We talked about the iCharOS initiative – but there are others springing up, trying to tackle this issue.  Sarah, you've done some digging into this, right? Tell us more about these efforts.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  One of the most impressive is iCharOS (Icarus), which is really focusing on testing a massive number of antibodies. They're working directly with antibody suppliers – getting the antibodies for testing free of charge!  They're rigorously testing them to see if they actually bind to the intended protein target, and publishing their findings.  The amazing thing is, they've already tested over a thousand antibodies, and found that two-thirds of them didn't work as advertised by the manufacturers.  

**Joe:** Wow, two-thirds!  That's a shockingly high failure rate.  So what happens when iCharOS finds a faulty antibody?

**Sarah:**  Well, the manufacturers are actually responding!  They're reassessing these antibodies, updating their recommendations, or even pulling some from the market entirely. It's a huge collaborative effort, and it's showing results.

**Joe:** That's fantastic to hear! It shows that this collaborative approach is really making a difference.  But as you mentioned, it’s not a perfect solution, right?

**Sarah:**  Right.  Even with iCharOS, there are limitations.  An antibody might work perfectly in one specific test, but behave differently in another context – a different cell type, a different tissue, or a different experimental technique.  That's where another initiative comes in: OMAPs (Organ Mapping Antibody Panels).

**Joe:**  So OMAPs tackles this "context" problem?

**Sarah:** Exactly.  Instead of focusing on one specific test for many antibodies, OMAPs focuses on one specific application – like imaging – but tests it across many different contexts.  They're getting researchers from universities and companies to test these antibodies in their own labs to see how they perform.  It's a really smart way of getting a broader picture of how reliable an antibody is.

**Joe:** This sounds like a really exciting and much-needed development in scientific research.  It highlights the importance of collaboration and rigorous testing, even for something as seemingly simple as an antibody.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  It’s a reminder that even the smallest tools in science need careful evaluation to ensure reliable and reproducible results, paving the way for more accurate and trustworthy scientific discoveries.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

Last time, we talked about the importance of reproducibility in science.  This time, we're looking at one of the key tools that can make or break an experiment: antibodies.

**Sarah:** Exactly, Joe.  It's easy to think of scientific research as all fancy equipment and complex experiments, but the reality is that even the smallest components can have a huge impact on the results.  And antibodies, these tiny workhorses, are a prime example.  We heard last time that even the best antibodies aren't always easy to find.

**Joe:** Right.  Imagine trying to find a specific screw in a massive hardware store with no clear labeling system – that's kind of what it was like for researchers before some smart people stepped in.  We learned about Anita Bandrowski and her work on RRIDs – research resource identifiers.  These are like unique serial numbers for antibodies, making them much easier to track down and ensuring everyone's using the same thing.

**Sarah:**  It's like a digital inventory system for scientific resources!  It’s a huge step forward for reproducibility. But even with RRIDs, finding a *good* antibody is still a challenge.  We also heard about CiteAb, a search engine specifically for antibodies, which helps researchers find the most highly cited ones.  That sounds helpful, but even then, it's not a guarantee of quality.

**Joe:** That's the crux of the problem, Sarah.  Just because an antibody is highly cited doesn't mean it's reliable.  We heard from Dr. Virk, who had a really frustrating experience with unreliable antibodies.  It almost drove him out of science!

**Sarah:**  That's shocking, but it highlights the real-world impact of this issue.  It’s not just about inconvenience; it's about wasted time, money, and potentially, incorrect scientific conclusions. That's why Dr. Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community.

**Joe:**  OGA is bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – everyone involved – to collaborate on solutions.  They're tackling this problem head-on, which is exactly the kind of collaborative effort we need to see more of in science.

**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  It's a reminder that science isn't done in isolation.  It's a team effort, and improving the reliability of even something as seemingly small as an antibody requires a collective effort from all stakeholders.

**Joe:**  It's a fascinating look behind the scenes of scientific research, highlighting the importance of careful attention to detail and the power of collaboration.  And it's a reminder that even the most basic tools need constant evaluation and improvement.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 **(Intro music fades)**

**Joe:** Welcome back to the show, everyone! Today, Sarah and I are diving into the fascinating, and slightly messy, world of scientific antibodies.  Last time, we talked about the importance of reproducibility in research.  This week, we’re focusing on one key area where that reproducibility has been a real challenge: antibodies.

**Sarah:** Exactly, Joe! Antibodies are these incredibly important tools used in countless scientific experiments, from medical research to developing new drugs. But for a long time, there's been a serious problem:  a lot of antibodies just didn't work as advertised, or worked inconsistently. This made it really difficult to replicate results, leading to wasted time, money, and potentially, flawed conclusions.

**Joe:**  So, what's the problem with these antibodies?  Are they just…badly made?

**Sarah:** It's more complicated than that. Traditionally, many antibodies were created using methods that produced batches with variations.  Think of it like baking a cake – if your recipe isn't precise, each cake will be slightly different.  This inconsistency in antibodies meant that experiments using them couldn't always be reliably repeated.

**Joe:**  I see. So, scientists were essentially working with slightly different ingredients every time.

**Sarah:** Precisely!  But things are changing. A big push is underway to switch to something called "recombinant antibodies."  These are made using genetically engineered cells, so you get a consistent product every time – like having a perfect, foolproof cake recipe.

**Joe:**  That sounds like a huge improvement!  Are all scientists on board with this change?

**Sarah:** Not yet.  There's been some resistance, with some researchers hesitant to switch from what they're used to.  Plus, switching over requires effort and validation.  But there's been a lot of progress.  Organizations like the OGA (Open Global Antibodies) community are working hard to improve antibody quality, provide better resources for researchers, and even incentivize the use of better antibodies through grants.  Antibody suppliers are also stepping up, producing more of these reliable recombinant antibodies.

**Joe:** It's great to hear that there's a collaborative effort to tackle this problem!  It really highlights how important it is for scientists to work together and share information.

**Sarah:** Absolutely!  And it also shows that even the most fundamental tools in science need constant evaluation and improvement. This whole antibody story is a great example of how science is a self-correcting process.  The problems are being identified, and the scientific community is actively working towards solutions.

**(Short musical interlude)**

**Joe:**  So, what's the takeaway for our listeners?

**Sarah:**  Even though there are still challenges, the future of antibody research looks much brighter.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies, along with the collaborative efforts of scientists, organizations, and manufacturers, is paving the way for more reliable and reproducible scientific research.  It's a reminder that science is a continuous journey of improvement, and that even seemingly small details can have a huge impact on the bigger picture.

**Joe:**  Exactly! And that's all the time we have for today.  Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time!

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Welcome to Podify, where we explore fascinating topics and stories from around the world.

Joe: Boston, the capital of Massachusetts and one of the oldest cities in the United States, is a vibrant blend of historical significance and modern innovation. Known as the "Cradle of Liberty," Boston played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, with iconic sites like the Freedom Trail, Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum, and Paul Revere's House drawing millions of visitors annually.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a really fascinating paper about… well, antibodies.  Specifically, the *huge* problem of unreliable antibodies in research.

Sarah: Antibodies?  Um, I know they're part of our immune system, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in scientific research.  Could you explain that a bit?

Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies, in a nutshell, are these molecules produced by our immune system to target specific things – like viruses or, you know, parts of proteins.  Scientists use them in the lab to, ah, essentially, highlight specific proteins they're studying.  They'll use an antibody that's designed to bind *only* to that protein. This lets them see where the protein is in a cell, how much of it there is, things like that.  It's a fundamental tool in a lot of biological research.

Sarah: Okay, so it's like… a really specific label for a particular protein?

Joe:  Yeah, that's a pretty good way to put it.  But here's the problem:  a lot of commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy—just don't work as advertised. They either don't bind to the target protein at all, or they bind to other things too, giving you completely false results.

Sarah:  Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  And potentially disastrous for research.  I mean, how common is this problem?

Joe:  Incredibly common.  The paper we're discussing highlights a researcher, Carl Laflamme, who was trying to study a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He found that out of sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein, only three actually worked properly.  And, get this,  a bunch of published papers used an antibody that *didn't even bind* to the target protein!  They've been cited thousands of times!

Sarah:  Thousands of times?! That’s… alarming. So what's causing this? Is it just shoddy manufacturing?

Joe:  It's a complex issue. Part of it is the way antibodies are made and tested.  The testing methods aren't always rigorous enough to ensure specificity and selectivity. Then there's the issue of the sheer volume of antibodies on the market.  There’s not enough robust independent verification of their quality.  It's a huge problem that's potentially slowing down scientific progress, leading to wasted resources and, you know, the reproducibility crisis we keep hearing about.

Sarah:  So what's being done to address this? Is there hope for better antibodies?

Joe: Absolutely! There are several initiatives springing up.  One mentioned in the paper is called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science –  which aims to rigorously test commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a step in the right direction.  There are also efforts focused on improving antibody production and testing methods.  It's a collaborative effort involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah:  That sounds like a really important, and frankly, huge project.  It’s encouraging to hear that people are actively working to solve this problem.  Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe.  It's definitely a topic many people should be aware of.


Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. It's a critical issue in the scientific community that needs more attention.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we delve into…

My pleasure, Sarah. It's a critical issue in the scientific community that needs more attention.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we delve into…

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 **(Sound of a gentle transition, then silence)**

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were talking about the antibody crisis, right?  The sheer number of commercially available antibodies – millions – and the surprisingly high failure rate.  It's a huge problem for research reproducibility.  YCharOS is a fascinating attempt to address this.  Their approach is pretty straightforward, actually.  They focus on rigorous characterization using a knockout cell line comparison.

**Sarah:**  Right, the knockout comparison. Could you explain that a little more simply for our listeners? I mean, I understand the general concept, but what are the specific steps involved?

**Joe:**  Sure.  So, they take a cell line that naturally expresses the target protein – you know, the protein the antibody *should* bind to.  Then, they compare that to a "knockout" cell line – genetically modified to *not* produce that protein. They test the antibody in both.  If the antibody only binds significantly in the normal cell line and shows minimal binding in the knockout, that indicates good specificity.  It's essentially a direct test of whether the antibody is actually binding to the intended target.

**Sarah:** So, it's a control experiment, essentially?  A negative control to confirm that the antibody isn't just binding to anything?

**Joe:** Exactly.  It's a very powerful negative control. And what's impressive about YCharOS is the scale – they've tested hundreds, even thousands of antibodies.  Their collaborative approach with manufacturers is also key.  They get the antibodies for free, the manufacturers get feedback, and everyone benefits from more reliable reagents.

**Sarah:** It sounds almost too good to be true. Is there a downside to this approach?  I mean, it's testing in a specific cell line, right?  What about the variability between different cell types, or different tissues?  Wouldn't the antibody's performance vary depending on the context?

**Joe:** You're right, that's a limitation.  The results are context-specific.  An antibody might perform perfectly in their chosen cell line but fail miserably in, say, brain tissue.  Cecilia Williams mentioned that in the article, right?  So, YCharOS's approach is a crucial first step, but it doesn't solve the entire problem.  Other initiatives, like OMAPs, are trying to address the broader context-dependent issues.

**Sarah:**  So, OMAPs takes a different approach?

**Joe:** Yes.  OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within a specific application – multiplex imaging – but across multiple contexts, different tissues, and methods.  It's a community-driven effort, relying on researchers from academia and industry to test the antibodies in their own labs. It's a much broader, more decentralized approach.

**Sarah:**  So, YCharOS provides a rigorous, controlled test in a specific context, while OMAPs focuses on real-world application validation across a range of contexts.  It's almost like two sides of the same coin, addressing different aspects of the same problem.

**Joe:**  Precisely.  And it highlights the complexity of the issue.  There's no single silver bullet solution. We need multiple approaches to tackle this widespread problem of unreliable antibodies.  It's a big undertaking, but crucial for the reliability of scientific research.

**Previous Context**:
**  Precisely.  And it highlights the complexity of the issue.  There's no single silver bullet solution. We need multiple approaches to tackle this widespread problem of unreliable antibodies.  It's a big undertaking, but crucial for the reliability of scientific research.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: So, Joe, this whole antibody reliability issue… it’s a real mess, isn’t it?  I mean, reading this, it sounds like a tangled web of problems.  We’ve got unreliable antibodies themselves, difficulty tracking them down, and then the whole validation process seems…  well, lacking.

Joe: Yeah, it's a pretty significant problem, Sarah.  It's not just one thing, you know? It's a confluence of factors.  The initial problem is that, um,  a lot of antibodies simply aren't properly characterized.  Researchers might use an antibody without knowing exactly what it binds to, or if it binds to anything other than the intended target. This lack of proper characterization leads directly to irreproducible results.  And then there's the issue of tracking them down.  Even if a good antibody *exists*, finding it can be incredibly difficult.

Sarah: Right.  This RRID system… that sounds like a step in the right direction, at least for tracking.  But it doesn't solve the underlying problem of the antibody itself being unreliable, does it?

Joe:  Exactly.  RRIDs are crucial for reproducibility; they provide a persistent identifier, even if a company discontinues a product or changes its catalog number.  Think of it as a permanent address for a specific antibody.  It helps researchers find the *same* antibody used in a previous study, but it doesn't guarantee that antibody is actually any good.

Sarah: So, we have a system to find the antibodies, but no guarantee of quality. That’s… frustrating.  What about CiteAb?  Is that helping with the quality control aspect?

Joe:  CiteAb is a useful tool. It aggregates information on antibody citations, giving you an idea of how frequently an antibody has been used.  And they are now incorporating validation data, which is a huge plus.  But, as the article mentions,  less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated through methods like knockout validation, which is considered the gold standard.  So, while it helps you find *popular* antibodies, it doesn't necessarily mean they are reliable.

Sarah:  So it's like popularity doesn't equal quality in this case.  And this whole thing about knockout validation...  can you explain that a little more simply?

Joe:  Sure.  Knockout validation basically means verifying that the antibody only binds to the target protein. You genetically remove the target protein from a cell or organism, and if the antibody no longer binds, you have strong evidence that it's specific.  It’s a rigorous test, but it’s not always feasible or done.

Sarah:  So, it’s a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.  That explains the low percentage.  This whole Only Good Antibodies community… that sounds like a really important initiative.

Joe:  Absolutely.  It's a collaborative effort to bring together all stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to address the problem systematically.  It's a recognition that this isn't something any single group can solve alone.  It requires a widespread change in practices and standards.  It's a long-term project, but it's essential for the future of reliable research.

Sarah:  It sounds like a monumental task, but hopefully, initiatives like OGA can make a real difference.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It’s a complicated issue, but your explanation helped a lot.

It sounds like a monumental task, but hopefully, initiatives like OGA can make a real difference.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It’s a complicated issue, but your explanation helped a lot.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: So, Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies and the OGA initiative.  It sounds like a huge undertaking to improve reproducibility in research.  One thing that struck me was the shift towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain simply why they're considered better than the older methods?

Joe:  Sure.  The older methods, using antibodies from immune cells or hybrids, led to batch-to-batch variability.  Each batch might be slightly different, affecting the results of experiments. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are made using genetically engineered cells programmed to produce a *specific* antibody.  This means you get consistent, identical antibodies in every batch.  That eliminates a major source of error.  It's like... well, it's not really like baking a cake, but if you had a recipe and always followed it exactly, every cake would be the same.  With the older methods, it was more like improvising – you'd get something cake-like, but not always the same.

Sarah:  Okay, that makes sense.  So, consistency is key.  But even with recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to validate them, right?  Why is that?

Joe:  Exactly.  Even though recombinant antibodies are more consistent, you still need to verify that they're actually binding to the target molecule they’re supposed to bind to.  There could be unforeseen issues with the genetic engineering process, or the antibody might not behave as expected in a particular experimental context. Validation is essentially a quality control step to ensure the antibody is fit for purpose.  It's not a guarantee of perfection, but it's a crucial step to increase confidence in the results.

Sarah:  So, it's not a perfect solution, but a significant improvement.  And it sounds like changing researcher behavior is a big hurdle.  Why is it so hard to convince researchers to switch to better methods, even if it benefits everyone in the long run?

Joe:  That's a really good point.  Inertia is a powerful force.  Researchers might have been using a particular antibody for years, and they're comfortable with it, even if it's not ideal.  They might also be hesitant to change their methods, particularly if it means extra work or costs.  Plus, there's a certain amount of trust involved. If a researcher has been using an antibody successfully for a long time, they might be reluctant to believe it isn't working as intended, even if evidence suggests otherwise.  There's a psychological aspect to it, you know?  It's not just about the science; it's about habits and trust.

Sarah:  Right, that makes a lot of sense. So, it's not just a technical challenge; it's a social and psychological one, too.  It sounds like the OGA initiative is trying to tackle all these aspects.  It’s a huge undertaking, but hopefully,  it can make a real, lasting difference.

Joe:  Absolutely.  It’s a multi-faceted problem requiring a collaborative, community-wide effort to address.  And the fact that younger researchers seem more open to collaboration gives me some hope for the future.

Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about validating antibodies.  That sounds… complicated.  Can you break that down a bit more for our listeners?  I mean, what exactly *is* antibody validation, and why is it so crucial?

Joe:  Right.  Well, antibody validation is essentially making sure the antibody actually does what it's supposed to do.  You know,  it's like...  (pauses)  no, let's not use an analogy.  It's about confirming that the antibody specifically binds to the intended target protein and nothing else.  If you're using an antibody to study a specific protein, you need absolute confidence it's only recognizing *that* protein. Otherwise, your results are garbage.

Sarah:  Garbage.  Okay, I get that.  So, how do researchers actually *do* this validation? You mentioned a few methods...

Joe: Yeah, there are several ways.  One common method is immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  Basically, you take a sample of cells or tissue, and you apply your antibody. If the antibody binds to its target protein in the cells, you'll see a signal, usually a color change, at the location of that protein.  It's a visual confirmation.

Sarah:  So, it's like... highlighting the protein of interest?

Joe:  Something like that, yeah.  But you have to be careful.  A positive signal doesn't automatically mean it's perfectly specific.  There could be non-specific binding.  That's why other methods are crucial.

Sarah:  Right.  And what are those other methods?

Joe:  Well, Western blotting is another one.  This separates proteins by size, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  So you get a band on the blot. You know, it's less about location and more about size and specificity.   Then there's immunoprecipitation. This is where you use the antibody to literally pull out the target protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then you can use something like mass spectrometry to identify exactly what protein you've pulled out. That’s a more definitive way to say, "yes, this antibody only binds to this protein."

Sarah:  So, essentially, you're using multiple techniques to cross-check and confirm the antibody's specificity.  It sounds incredibly thorough, but also... intense.  No wonder there's so much concern about unreliable antibodies.

Joe: Exactly.  It's time-consuming and requires a lot of expertise.  And even then, there's always a degree of uncertainty. That's why collaboration and open sharing of data are so important.

Sarah:  Absolutely.  It all sounds incredibly important for reliable scientific research. Thanks for clarifying all of that, Joe. That was a lot to unpack.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial part of the scientific process, and often overlooked, unfortunately.

Sarah:  It certainly shouldn't be.  So, on that note…

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a really fascinating paper about… well, antibodies.  Specifically, the *huge* problem of unreliable antibodies in research.
[INFO] Sarah: Antibodies?  Um, I know they're part of our immune system, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in scientific research.  Could you explain that a bit?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies, in a nutshell, are these molecules produced by our immune system to target specific things – like viruses or, you know, parts of proteins.  Scientists use them in the lab to, ah, essentially, highlight specific proteins they're studying.  They'll use an antibody that's designed to bind *only* to that protein. This lets them see where the protein is in a cell, how much of it there is, things like that.  It's a fundamental tool in a lot of biological research.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like… a really specific label for a particular protein?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's a pretty good way to put it.  But here's the problem:  a lot of commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy—just don't work as advertised. They either don't bind to the target protein at all, or they bind to other things too, giving you completely false results.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  And potentially disastrous for research.  I mean, how common is this problem?
[INFO] Joe: Incredibly common.  The paper we're discussing highlights a researcher, Carl Laflamme, who was trying to study a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He found that out of sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein, only three actually worked properly.  And, get this,  a bunch of published papers used an antibody that *didn't even bind* to the target protein!  They've been cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Thousands of times?! That’s… alarming. So what's causing this? Is it just shoddy manufacturing?
[INFO] Joe: It's a complex issue. Part of it is the way antibodies are made and tested.  The testing methods aren't always rigorous enough to ensure specificity and selectivity. Then there's the issue of the sheer volume of antibodies on the market.  There’s not enough robust independent verification of their quality.  It's a huge problem that's potentially slowing down scientific progress, leading to wasted resources and, you know, the reproducibility crisis we keep hearing about.
[INFO] Sarah: So what's being done to address this? Is there hope for better antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely! There are several initiatives springing up.  One mentioned in the paper is called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science –  which aims to rigorously test commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a step in the right direction.  There are also efforts focused on improving antibody production and testing methods.  It's a collaborative effort involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a really important, and frankly, huge project.  It’s encouraging to hear that people are actively working to solve this problem.  Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe.  It's definitely a topic many people should be aware of.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. It's a critical issue in the scientific community that needs more attention.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we delve into…
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, we were talking about the antibody crisis, right?  The sheer number of commercially available antibodies – millions – and the surprisingly high failure rate.  It's a huge problem for research reproducibility.  YCharOS is a fascinating attempt to address this.  Their approach is pretty straightforward, actually.  They focus on rigorous characterization using a knockout cell line comparison.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right, the knockout comparison. Could you explain that a little more simply for our listeners? I mean, I understand the general concept, but what are the specific steps involved?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  So, they take a cell line that naturally expresses the target protein – you know, the protein the antibody *should* bind to.  Then, they compare that to a "knockout" cell line – genetically modified to *not* produce that protein. They test the antibody in both.  If the antibody only binds significantly in the normal cell line and shows minimal binding in the knockout, that indicates good specificity.  It's essentially a direct test of whether the antibody is actually binding to the intended target.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's a control experiment, essentially?  A negative control to confirm that the antibody isn't just binding to anything?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  It's a very powerful negative control. And what's impressive about YCharOS is the scale – they've tested hundreds, even thousands of antibodies.  Their collaborative approach with manufacturers is also key.  They get the antibodies for free, the manufacturers get feedback, and everyone benefits from more reliable reagents.
[INFO] Sarah: ** It sounds almost too good to be true. Is there a downside to this approach?  I mean, it's testing in a specific cell line, right?  What about the variability between different cell types, or different tissues?  Wouldn't the antibody's performance vary depending on the context?
[INFO] Joe: ** You're right, that's a limitation.  The results are context-specific.  An antibody might perform perfectly in their chosen cell line but fail miserably in, say, brain tissue.  Cecilia Williams mentioned that in the article, right?  So, YCharOS's approach is a crucial first step, but it doesn't solve the entire problem.  Other initiatives, like OMAPs, are trying to address the broader context-dependent issues.
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes.  OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within a specific application – multiplex imaging – but across multiple contexts, different tissues, and methods.  It's a community-driven effort, relying on researchers from academia and industry to test the antibodies in their own labs. It's a much broader, more decentralized approach.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, OMAPs takes a different approach?
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, YCharOS provides a rigorous, controlled test in a specific context, while OMAPs focuses on real-world application validation across a range of contexts.  It's almost like two sides of the same coin, addressing different aspects of the same problem.
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely.  And it highlights the complexity of the issue.  There's no single silver bullet solution. We need multiple approaches to tackle this widespread problem of unreliable antibodies.  It's a big undertaking, but crucial for the reliability of scientific research.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, this whole antibody reliability issue… it’s a real mess, isn’t it?  I mean, reading this, it sounds like a tangled web of problems.  We’ve got unreliable antibodies themselves, difficulty tracking them down, and then the whole validation process seems…  well, lacking.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a pretty significant problem, Sarah.  It's not just one thing, you know? It's a confluence of factors.  The initial problem is that, um,  a lot of antibodies simply aren't properly characterized.  Researchers might use an antibody without knowing exactly what it binds to, or if it binds to anything other than the intended target. This lack of proper characterization leads directly to irreproducible results.  And then there's the issue of tracking them down.  Even if a good antibody *exists*, finding it can be incredibly difficult.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  RRIDs are crucial for reproducibility; they provide a persistent identifier, even if a company discontinues a product or changes its catalog number.  Think of it as a permanent address for a specific antibody.  It helps researchers find the *same* antibody used in a previous study, but it doesn't guarantee that antibody is actually any good.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  This RRID system… that sounds like a step in the right direction, at least for tracking.  But it doesn't solve the underlying problem of the antibody itself being unreliable, does it?
[INFO] Sarah: So, we have a system to find the antibodies, but no guarantee of quality. That’s… frustrating.  What about CiteAb?  Is that helping with the quality control aspect?
[INFO] Joe: CiteAb is a useful tool. It aggregates information on antibody citations, giving you an idea of how frequently an antibody has been used.  And they are now incorporating validation data, which is a huge plus.  But, as the article mentions,  less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated through methods like knockout validation, which is considered the gold standard.  So, while it helps you find *popular* antibodies, it doesn't necessarily mean they are reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's like popularity doesn't equal quality in this case.  And this whole thing about knockout validation...  can you explain that a little more simply?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Knockout validation basically means verifying that the antibody only binds to the target protein. You genetically remove the target protein from a cell or organism, and if the antibody no longer binds, you have strong evidence that it's specific.  It’s a rigorous test, but it’s not always feasible or done.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it’s a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.  That explains the low percentage.  This whole Only Good Antibodies community… that sounds like a really important initiative.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a collaborative effort to bring together all stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to address the problem systematically.  It's a recognition that this isn't something any single group can solve alone.  It requires a widespread change in practices and standards.  It's a long-term project, but it's essential for the future of reliable research.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task, but hopefully, initiatives like OGA can make a real difference.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It’s a complicated issue, but your explanation helped a lot.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies and the OGA initiative.  It sounds like a huge undertaking to improve reproducibility in research.  One thing that struck me was the shift towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain simply why they're considered better than the older methods?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  The older methods, using antibodies from immune cells or hybrids, led to batch-to-batch variability.  Each batch might be slightly different, affecting the results of experiments. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are made using genetically engineered cells programmed to produce a *specific* antibody.  This means you get consistent, identical antibodies in every batch.  That eliminates a major source of error.  It's like... well, it's not really like baking a cake, but if you had a recipe and always followed it exactly, every cake would be the same.  With the older methods, it was more like improvising – you'd get something cake-like, but not always the same.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense.  So, consistency is key.  But even with recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to validate them, right?  Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Even though recombinant antibodies are more consistent, you still need to verify that they're actually binding to the target molecule they’re supposed to bind to.  There could be unforeseen issues with the genetic engineering process, or the antibody might not behave as expected in a particular experimental context. Validation is essentially a quality control step to ensure the antibody is fit for purpose.  It's not a guarantee of perfection, but it's a crucial step to increase confidence in the results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not a perfect solution, but a significant improvement.  And it sounds like changing researcher behavior is a big hurdle.  Why is it so hard to convince researchers to switch to better methods, even if it benefits everyone in the long run?
[INFO] Joe: That's a really good point.  Inertia is a powerful force.  Researchers might have been using a particular antibody for years, and they're comfortable with it, even if it's not ideal.  They might also be hesitant to change their methods, particularly if it means extra work or costs.  Plus, there's a certain amount of trust involved. If a researcher has been using an antibody successfully for a long time, they might be reluctant to believe it isn't working as intended, even if evidence suggests otherwise.  There's a psychological aspect to it, you know?  It's not just about the science; it's about habits and trust.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, that makes a lot of sense. So, it's not just a technical challenge; it's a social and psychological one, too.  It sounds like the OGA initiative is trying to tackle all these aspects.  It’s a huge undertaking, but hopefully,  it can make a real, lasting difference.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It’s a multi-faceted problem requiring a collaborative, community-wide effort to address.  And the fact that younger researchers seem more open to collaboration gives me some hope for the future.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about validating antibodies.  That sounds… complicated.  Can you break that down a bit more for our listeners?  I mean, what exactly *is* antibody validation, and why is it so crucial?
[INFO] Joe: Right.  Well, antibody validation is essentially making sure the antibody actually does what it's supposed to do.  You know,  it's like...  (pauses)  no, let's not use an analogy.  It's about confirming that the antibody specifically binds to the intended target protein and nothing else.  If you're using an antibody to study a specific protein, you need absolute confidence it's only recognizing *that* protein. Otherwise, your results are garbage.
[INFO] Sarah: Garbage.  Okay, I get that.  So, how do researchers actually *do* this validation? You mentioned a few methods...
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, there are several ways.  One common method is immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  Basically, you take a sample of cells or tissue, and you apply your antibody. If the antibody binds to its target protein in the cells, you'll see a signal, usually a color change, at the location of that protein.  It's a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like... highlighting the protein of interest?
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  And what are those other methods?
[INFO] Joe: Well, Western blotting is another one.  This separates proteins by size, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  So you get a band on the blot. You know, it's less about location and more about size and specificity.   Then there's immunoprecipitation. This is where you use the antibody to literally pull out the target protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then you can use something like mass spectrometry to identify exactly what protein you've pulled out. That’s a more definitive way to say, "yes, this antibody only binds to this protein."
[INFO] Joe: Something like that, yeah.  But you have to be careful.  A positive signal doesn't automatically mean it's perfectly specific.  There could be non-specific binding.  That's why other methods are crucial.
[INFO] Sarah: So, essentially, you're using multiple techniques to cross-check and confirm the antibody's specificity.  It sounds incredibly thorough, but also... intense.  No wonder there's so much concern about unreliable antibodies.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's time-consuming and requires a lot of expertise.  And even then, there's always a degree of uncertainty. That's why collaboration and open sharing of data are so important.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely.  It all sounds incredibly important for reliable scientific research. Thanks for clarifying all of that, Joe. That was a lot to unpack.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial part of the scientific process, and often overlooked, unfortunately.
[INFO] Sarah: It certainly shouldn't be.  So, on that note…

Joe: CHAPTER ONE Magic Monday It was Monday morning and Mira Desai was VERY excited. This was no ordinary Monday morning. This Monday morning was the first day of the holidays AND it was Miras first day at a new school! Because this was no ordinary school . . . this was: Mira had been desperate to go to Unicorn School since her sister Rani started going two summers ago. Rani wouldnt stop going on about how wonderful her unicorn (Angelica) was. She kept saying how amazing she was at all the magical quests. And she was always making whinnying noises in Miras ear to make her jealous. AND shed brought home about a hundred Unicorn School quest medals, which had their own special shelf in the living room. Rani said that quests could go on for days and days and were super exciting. And the time Rani spent at Unicorn School did seem like ages to Mira. But time passed differently at Unicorn School, and Rani was really only ever gone for a day in normal time. Mira had dreamed of having her own unicorn since FOREVER. She practised plaiting the manes and tails of all her toy horses, persuaded her dad to let her groom his beard and even tried attaching a horn to their cat, Pickles. He wasnt very pleased. It was a bit of a mystery who was selected to go to Unicorn School and who wasnt. Lots of people from Miras family had gone to Unicorn School, including Miras mum, so Mira hoped more than anything that she would get to go, too. Mira always tried to live her life as open to magic as possible. She wished on stars, she believed in fairies, she said hello to black cats who crossed her path. And then, one incredible day, Mira woke up with a sparkly envelope on her pillow. Mira remembered it as if it was yesterday. (It was actually last Thursday.) She screamed so loudly that Pickles flung himself off Miras bed into a pile of dirty clothes, and Miras dad came running in to check what was wrong. But there was nothing wrong. Everything was finally right. Her hands shaking with excitement, Mira opened the letter: Dear Mira Desai, We are delighted to invite you to join us at Unicorn School. You will be in Class RED. Please use the Magic Portal to access the school. We look forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely, Madame Shetland DAD! Mira yelled and started jumping on the bed. IM GOING TO UNICORN SCHOOL! Terrified, Pickles jumped on to Miras dads face and wouldnt let go of his beard. Mfmfmfmf! he said cheerfully and gave Mira a thumbs up, before leaving the room and walking into the wall. Mira reached inside the envelope and pulled out a leaflet containing all the information about the school, including a map and the School Rules. Mira thought she might faint with delight. Unicorn School was going to be BRILLIANT! For one thing, Mira couldnt WAIT to bring home her own medals. Shed already started making a space for them on the shelf (and had accidentally knocked a couple of Ranis medals into Pickless bowl). But the thing Mira was MOST excited about was getting to meet her unicorn. Her sister said that the unicorns were specially chosen for each person for specific magical reasons. You would get to spend all day every day with your unicorn: going to lessons, working on projects and going on quests. (Basically your unicorn would be your best friend.) Mira did have a best friend already at normal school (Katie with a K) but she could definitely squeeze another one into her life. Shed spent a lot of time thinking about her dream unicorn best friend (Princess Delilah Sparklehoof). Shed filled a whole notebook with drawings of her and made a list of all the brilliant things they would do together. 1. Have amazing, magical adventures! 2. Be great at quests 3. Get LOADS OF MEDALS Before heading to the Magic Portal that would take them to Unicorn School, Miras mum took them to the supermarket. Mira and Rani needed to get treats for their unicorns and Mum needed to buy doughnuts for someones birthday at work. Mira was wondering what treats unicorns like.

Sarah:

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: Hey everyone!  It's Sarah here, ready to join Joe on this super magical adventure to Unicorn School!  Joe, tell us more about Mira's exciting first day!

Joe:  Woohoo!  So, Mira's super excited because today's not just the first day of her holidays, it's her first day at Unicorn School! Can you believe it?  Imagine getting to go to a school where your classmates are unicorns!  What kind of pet would YOU want to take to school if you could?  A fluffy bunny?  A skateboarding hamster? Let us know in the comments!

Sarah: Oh, I'd totally bring a tiny dragon!  But it would have to be a really well-behaved one, of course,  no fire-breathing in class!  So, Joe, what's this Magic Portal Mira's going to use? Is it like a rainbow slide?

Joe:  Even better!  It's a secret!  But it sounds pretty amazing, right?  Before she goes, Mira and Rani are at the supermarket getting treats for their unicorns!  Now, this is a tricky one for our listeners – what do YOU think unicorns might like to eat?  Is it rainbow sprinkles?  Magic mushrooms?  Sparkly carrots?

Sarah: Ooh, I bet they love rainbow sprinkles! And maybe some glittery apples!  But what about the School Rules? Joe, what are the Unicorn School rules like?  Are there any rules we can guess?

Joe:  Great question, Sarah! That’s what makes this so fun!  We don't know all the rules yet, but I bet there's a rule about no kicking other unicorns. And probably a rule about no using magic to cheat on tests! And maybe one about always being kind to your unicorn! What other rules do you think there are at Unicorn School? Let's hear your ideas!

Sarah: I bet there's a rule about brushing your unicorn's mane every day! And maybe one about sharing your sparkly treats!  This is so exciting!  I can't wait to hear what happens next!

Joe: Me neither!  Mira's already dreaming about her unicorn, Princess Delilah Sparklehoof, and all the amazing adventures they'll have together!  Remember kids,  always believe in magic and never stop dreaming!  We'll be back after a quick break with more from Mira's incredible first day at Unicorn School!

Sarah: Which aisle do you go to for magic treats? she thought to herself. But when she asked her sister Rani rolled her eyes and said, Unicorns like carrots, obviously. And so they all headed over to the vegetable aisle. When theyd bought their carrots they went back to the car. Rani also had some hay left over from last term and Mum thought it would be nice if she shared it with Mira. The Magic Portal was in the car park by the leisure centre. Mira had never actually seen it the portal could only be seen by current Unicorn School pupils. Even Miras mum couldnt see it any more, since she had left Unicorn School roughly a thousand years ago. Usually when they dropped her off, Rani got out round the corner so that she wouldnt be seen with them. But TODAY Mira would be going with her. And she would be one step closer to meeting her unicorn! There had been quite a bit of traffic on the way and Mum was running late for work. Its okay, Mum, said Rani. Ill take Mira through. Mum looked from one sister to the other and then at her watch. Fine, she said. And then she fixed Rani with a LOOK. Make sure you take care of your little sister on her first day. Mum handed them their treat bags, gave them both a hug and jumped back in the car. Rani had already started stomping off when Mum rolled down her window. She leaned out with her phone in hand. Girls! Let me take a picture. Your first day at Unicorn School together! Rani turned, tutted and folded her arms. MUM, are you crying? Thats so embarrassing. Mum sniffed. It brings back such amazing memories of MY first day at Unicorn School! Oh, happy times . . . Their mum stared off into the distance for a moment, before she smiled again and blew her nose. Now, smile girls! Rani rolled her eyes. Mira smiled and gave two thumbs up as Mums phone camera CLICKED. Love you, girls. Have fun! Mum drove off, waving one hand at them out of the window as she left the car park. Mira felt a bit nervous. Wheres the Magic Portal? she asked Rani. Over here, said her sister. Come on. Rani stopped by the wheelie bins in the corner of the car park. So you have to get in the bin, spin round three times and then jump out and scream. Then youll be at Unicorn School, she said. Mira looked up at the bin. Are you sure? she said. Er, which one of us has a medal for being the Best at the Magic Portal? said her sister. Okay . . . said Mira. Mira clambered into the bin and held her breath. This was SO exciting! (Also, it really stank.) In just a few seconds shed be in Unicorn School . . . CHAPTER TWO Through the Portal Mira leaped out of the bin, yelling at the top of her voice. AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGH! came the reply, as she collided with someone. Mira looked down to see a boy on the ground, staring up at her with wide eyes. Behind him was a man cowering by a bike rack. Oh, hello! said Mira, as she helped the boy up. Sorry about that. The boy stared at her warily. So this is Unicorn School, she said, looking around. To be honest, it didnt look very different to the leisure centre car park. Uh no, said the man by the bike racks. Mira supposed he must be the boys dad because they looked quite alike and had matching briefcases. This is where you go through the Magic Portal to get to the school. Raheem is just about to go through. He gestured at the boy, who gulped. But said Mira, as she looked around for her sister who was nowhere to be seen. And then she realized Rani had tricked her and gone through on her own! TYPICAL. We can show you if you like? said Raheems dad. Its Raheems first day. Weve had twelve practice runs, just to be safe. He squeezed Raheems shoulder. Do . . . do you live in that bin? squeaked Raheem. No! I was just . . . resting there before I went through the portal, said Mira. Its my first day too Im Mira. It would be brilliant if you could show me. She followed the two of them past the bins and to a little clump of bushes at the edge of the car park.

**Joe:** Hey there, podcast adventurers! Welcome back to Podify Kids!  I'm Joe!

**Sarah:** And I'm Sarah!  And boy, oh boy, did Mira have a surprise waiting for her at Unicorn School! Remember Rani, Mira's older sister, who’s *supposed* to be helping her?

**Joe:**  Yeah!  Last time, Mira and Rani were ready to go through the Magic Portal… but things didn't quite go as planned!  Remember kids, sometimes even magic needs a little bit of… well, let's just say *unpredictability*!

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  Rani, being the *hilarious* older sister she is, played a little trick on Mira! Instead of a magical portal, Mira found herself… well, let's just say she had a *very* smelly encounter with a wheelie bin!

**(Sound of a cartoon "boing" sound effect)**

**Joe:**  Ha!  Can you imagine?  A magic portal disguised as… a wheelie bin? That's some serious sisterly mischief!

**Sarah:**  It is! And poor Mira, after leaping out of the bin with a mighty yell, she bumped into Raheem and his dad! They were waiting to go through the *real* magic portal!

**Joe:**  Oh no!  A case of mistaken identity!  This sounds like the start of a fantastic new friendship!  Kids, have you ever had a funny misunderstanding with a friend? Tell us about it!

**(Sound of a short, upbeat musical interlude)**

**Sarah:** So, Mira, feeling a little bit embarrassed but also super excited, explains that it's her first day too.  Raheem's dad, super nice guy, decides to show her the *actual* Magic Portal!

**Joe:**  Imagine this, kids! You’re about to go to a magical school, but first, you have to find a hidden portal! Where do you think the *real* portal might be hidden? Is it behind a giant mushroom? Inside a talking tree?  Let your imagination run wild!

**Sarah:**  Exactly! It turns out, the portal wasn't hidden in a wheelie bin at all but was cleverly concealed behind a clump of bushes!  Who would have guessed?!

**Joe:**  See? Sometimes magic is all about looking in the right places!  That’s a great lesson for everyone, even grown-ups!  It's like searching for your favorite toy – sometimes it’s hiding in plain sight!

**Sarah:**  And that's where our adventure ends for today, kids! But don't worry, we'll be back next time to see what amazing adventures await Mira at Unicorn School! Don't forget to subscribe and share Podify Kids with your friends!

Joe: Raheem and his dad showed her a gap in the branches where the air looked kind of wobbly and shimmery. Magic, thought Mira. Her tummy gave a little lurch. This was really it! Mira waited for Raheem to say bye to his dad. It took a while because they checked Raheems briefcase twice and then sang a song about the ten Rules of Keeping Safe. But finally Mira and Raheem crawled through the gap in the bushes and into a clearing. Everything looked just a little bit sparkly. Okay, breathed Mira. Ready? Erfg, said Raheem. Mira decided to take that as a yes. She grabbed his arm with one hand and reached out towards the sparkles . . . There was a flash of light that split into the seven colours of the rainbow. Mira felt herself being lifted up and before she knew it they were hurtling through the air. Miras toes tingled and a giggly feeling tickled up her legs, into her tummy and arms and head. Even her hair felt excited. Everything was already so magical, she could hardly stand it. She was on her way to Unicorn School! HOW FUN IS THIS? Mira yelled to Raheem, but he was too busy screaming to reply. Just as quickly as it had appeared, the rainbow light vanished, and for a moment the two of them hung in the air, before dropping with a thump onto a soft haystack. They climbed off the landing haystack, just as the next children were deposited by the rainbow. Mira looked around her and pulled strands of hay out of her hair. In front of them was Unicorn School. It was HUGE. It had turrets and a clocktower and looked a bit like a castle, but lots of it was all on one level, like a bungalow. (Because unicorns dont like stairs, Mira thought. There was nothing about unicorns that she didnt know.) Rani had told Mira that the dormitories, where the pupils slept at night- time, were up in the turrets and that the unicorns slept in their stables. The stables were in a large cobbled yard in front of the school. On the other side of the yard were fields with jumps set up. Those must be where the riding lessons are, Mira thought. She had never been horse- riding, but she had ridden a one-eared donkey at the beach last summer. She thought that unicorn-riding must be easier than that and there would be less chance of falling in the sea. Behind the school, Mira could see the forest and, behind that, enormous ice-capped mountains. Rani said that the Fearsome Forest was where lots of the quests took place. It was huge stretching as far as Mira could see. Miras toes were still tingling. She turned to Raheem and grinned. He still looked a bit vomity from the journey. The rainbow had dropped them off to the side of the Grand Paddock, which seemed to be the school playground for humans and unicorns. Real. Live. Actual. Unicorns! Groups of older kids stood chatting, each with a unicorn next to them, like it was no big deal. Mira realized her mouth was open in astonishment, and quickly closed it. One group were playing football, but they were riding their unicorns, and the unicorns were kicking the ball with their hooves! And over in a far corner of the field some unicorns and their riders were leaping over the jumps. Mira thought they looked a bit like they were flying. Rani had told her that the unicorns developed magical powers as they got older, and that some of them could fly! The excited feeling in Miras chest got bigger and bigger until she felt like she might burst. The unicorns were all amazing different colours with long legs, sleek, glossy manes and glittery horns. It was amazing to think that soon Mira would meet her very own unicorn! Just then Mira heard a burst of laughter to her right. There was Rani and her friends. They were in the third year now Class Yellow. You started in Class Red and then moved up through the colours of the rainbow. And each year you had another stripe added to your school badge. Mira looked at the badge on the sleeve of her T-shirt.

**Joe:** Hey kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids! I'm Joe!

**Sarah:** And I'm Sarah!  And boy, oh boy, do we have an exciting episode for you today! We're continuing Mira's amazing adventure at Unicorn School! Remember all those sparkly rainbows and the super-fast flight?

**Joe:**  Yeah!  Last time, Mira and Raheem arrived at Unicorn School – and wow, was it HUGE!  It was like a magical castle-bungalow! Remember, Sarah, why it's a bungalow?

**Sarah:**  Because unicorns don't like stairs!  Clever unicorns!  So, they zoomed through the rainbow and landed in the Grand Paddock – which is basically the unicorn playground!  And guess what they saw?

**Joe:** REAL LIVE UNICORNS!!! Can you imagine?! Unicorns playing football on their unicorns!  That's like playing soccer on a bouncy castle, but way cooler!

**(Sound of a playful "neigh")**

**Sarah:**  And some unicorns were even jumping!  It looked like they were flying!  Mira learned that as unicorns get older, they develop magical powers – some can even FLY!  Isn't that incredible?

**Joe:** It's like learning to ride a bike, but instead of a bike, it's a magical unicorn, and instead of falling, you might just start flying!  Who wants to learn to fly on a unicorn?

**(Sound of kids cheering)**

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And Mira saw Rani and her friends! Remember Rani?  She's in Class Yellow!

**Joe:** That's right!  They start in Class Red, then move up through all the colors of the rainbow!  Each year, they get a new stripe on their badge!  Like a rainbow progress report!

**Sarah:**  Here's a fun question for you, listeners!  If Mira starts in Class Red and moves up through the rainbow, what color class will she be in after Yellow?

**(Pause for a few seconds)**

**Joe:** That's right, Green!  Good job, everyone!  And guess what? Mira is about to meet her very own unicorn!

**Sarah:**  Isn't that exciting?  Imagine meeting your own personal unicorn! What would you name your unicorn?  Let us know in the comments!

**Joe:** That's all for today, kids!  Join us next time to find out what happens when Mira meets her unicorn!  Don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical adventures!

Sarah: What would it look like when she had a full rainbow? Um, said Raheem, taking her out of her daydream. I think we go over there. Turning away from her sister, Mira followed Raheem over to a big banner near the stables that read: WELCOME TO UNICORN SCHOOL, CLASS RED! CHAPTER THREE Unicorn Best Friend Forever! The bell in the clocktower chimed and everyone gathered in their classes. Miras class was the only one with just humans each of the other six class groups were made up of children and unicorns! Seven teachers filed out of the school. Each of them wore a differentcoloured rosette with their name on. A tall, dark-haired teacher stopped in front of Miras class. She was wearing a red rosette which said, Miss Glitterhorn. Good morning, Class Red, said Miss Glitterhorn. Good moooooorning, Miss Glitterhorn! chorused Class Red. Now, before we head into assembly to meet the unicorns, I thought that it would be nice if we all got to know each other! trilled Miss Glitterhorn. Mira sighed. She was SO impatient to meet her new unicorn best friend . . . but she did like the idea of learning her classmates names. After all, they would be her friends too! A girl at the front put her hand up. She had blonde curly hair and was in a wheelchair with rainbow wheels. Yes? Miss Glitterhorn beamed. Do you actually have a horn? No, I dont, said Miss Glitterhorn. She smiled. Now, well all play a getting-to-know-you game where The girl put her hand up again. Yes? said Miss Glitterhorn. Do you have unicorns in your family? No, I dont, said Miss Glitterhorn. She smiled again, although it was a bit smaller this time. So we The girl put her hand up again. So, is it a coincidence that you are called Miss Glitterhorn? YES, said Miss Glitterhorn. Anyway After seventeen questions Miss Glitterhorn decided that actually they would go straight to the assembly and they could get to know each other on the way. Mira and Raheem walked alongside the girl whod been asking all the questions. She told them her name was Darcy and that she was going to be famous one day. Wow, said Raheem. How will you be famous? Darcy shrugged. Ill win a TV talent show probably. My dad says those shows are for people with no talent, said a boy walking next to them. His footsteps were really loud and Mira saw that he was wearing cowboy boots. He had a mop of dirty blond hair and a smug mouth. Mira had heard him saying earlier how his parents were Olympic showjumpers and were making sure he was given the best unicorn. Darcy opened her mouth to reply, but theyd reached the hall and a sternlooking teacher gave her a warning look. Mira gasped when she saw the Great Hall, which was in the centre of the main school building. It was a beautiful indoor paddock and the grass was sprinkled with wildflowers. At one end was a platform, with a glittery mounting block next to it. Around the sides of the hall was a gallery for people to sit in. The other six classes were already there with their unicorns. Miss Glitterhorn pointed Class Red to the front row. Mira felt a flutter of pride. Her sister would be there to see her get her unicorn! A hush descended on the hall, and a tiny woman walked across the paddock and onto the platform. Miss Glitterhorn joined her a moment later, clutching an armful of scrolls and a clipboard. The first woman introduced herself she was Madame Shetland, the head teacher. Madame Shetland cleared her throat and spoke into her microphone. Good morning children and unicorns, and welcome to a new term at Unicorn School. And an extra special welcome to our new students, Class Red, who I trust have been busy learning the School Rules in preparation, said the head teacher. Unicorn School is a place of fun, magic and adventure but it is something to be taken seriously. The bond between child and unicorn is a noble tradition, going back many centuries.

Joe: Alongside your unicorn you will learn and grow to undertake quests and become the protectors of our land, and shine a glittery light throughout the unicorn world. Mira felt a warm glow as she thought how she would definitely take it seriously. And she would definitely follow ALL the rules. As soon as she knew what they were. The head teacher smiled at the gathered pupils. And, of course, even when not at Unicorn School you will take forth the lessons learned here and promote the principles of friendship, kindness, bravery and tolerance. After everyone applauded Madame Shetland, it was FINALLY time for the pairing of Class Red with their unicorns. Mira thought she might explode! Miss Glitterhorn handed the head teacher the clipboard. Jake de Quincy, said Madame Shetland, looking at the clipboard. Mira saw a boy walking up to the platform. It was the one with blonde hair who was wearing cowboy boots. He was carrying his own riding hat with golden wings over the ears. Madame Shetland held the microphone towards Jake. If you could tell us about yourself. Keep it brief. Jake leaned in to the microphone. Im Jake. And Im going to be a champion unicorn showjumper, just like my mum and dad. Miss Glitterhorn handed Jake a scroll, which he held up in front of him. The name of your unicorn will appear on the scroll, declared Madame Shetland. The class gasped as a projection of the scroll appeared on the wall behind him. There was a hushed silence as they waited. The scroll shimmered and then a blurry word appeared. Everyone leaned forward to try and read it as the letters gradually became clear and sharp: Then there was a loud noise from the front of the hall as the double doors swung open, making them all jump. Mira let out an excited squeal and Raheem nearly fell off his chair. Standing proudly in the doorway, was a sparkling, majestic unicorn. He was deep purple with a dark blue mane and a glittering golden horn. He strode towards the mounting block where Jake waited with his arms folded and his eyebrows arched confidently. Mira couldnt contain her excitement and gripped the hands of Raheem and Darcy, until Darcy muttered to her to get off and Raheem looked really uncomfortable. Jake and Pegasus walked away from the platform to the other end of the hall, and Mira felt slightly relieved that they wouldnt have to ride the unicorns in front of everyone. Darcy was the next to be called. She wheeled up a ramp and onto the platform. Madame Shetland held the microphone towards her and Darcy grabbed it. Wow. What can I say? This moment means SO much. I want to thank my mum A speech is not necessary, Darcy! interrupted Madame Shetland. Darcys scroll appeared on the projection. A dramatic whinny came from the double doors and the class turned to look. A unicorn came strutting in her silver coat shimmered and caught the light as she walked. She arrived next to Darcy, swished her mane and struck a pose. Darcy applauded in delight. They made their way over to Jake and Pegasus, and started taking selfies until a teacher confiscated Darcys phone. Next was Seb, who said he loved art. He looked super-excited to meet his unicorn, Firework, who had a rainbow-coloured mane. Then it was Raheems turn. He stayed frozen to his seat when his name was called so Mira gave him an encouraging shove to get him to his feet. Good luck! she whispered. He gulped and made his way to the platform. My name is Raheem and I like books, he said carefully into the microphone. I bet he gets a really clever unicorn, thought Mira. Itll probably be able to read and everything. A loud thundering sound could be heard from outside the hall and the floor seemed to shake. And then a blue shape came galloping into the hall. The unicorn was a blur, racing around the hall before coming to a sudden stop in front of the platform with a stamp of his front hoof. He was midnight blue and the biggest, tallest unicorn theyd seen so far.

**(Sound of a playful "whoosh" effect)**

**Sarah:** Whoa! That sounds like a super-powered unicorn!  Like a superhero unicorn!  What do you think its superpower is, Joe?  Super speed?  Super strength?  Super reading?

**Joe:**  Maybe all three! It was so fast, it was a blur!  And it was SO big! Imagine a unicorn so tall it could peek over the tallest building in your city!

**(Sound of a galloping unicorn)**

**Sarah:** That's incredible!  I wish I could see that unicorn!  Okay, kids, imagine this: You're at Unicorn School too! What kind of unicorn would YOU want, and what would you name it?

Sarah: Madame Shetland turned to Raheem, only to find he wasnt there, but she soon coaxed him out from behind the mounting block. Brave strutted over to the line of unicorns with Raheem following at a careful distance. More and more children were called up. As each name was read out Mira felt her heart leap into her throat, and then sink back down again. Finally, she looked around and realized she was the only one in Class Red without a unicorn. And finally we have Mira Des began Madame Shetland and then she jumped to see Mira already standing next to her. Im Mira. And I cant wait to meet my unicorn best friend, said Mira into the microphone. She looked over at her sister in the crowd, who gave a deliberate yawn. And I cant wait to win LOADS of medals, said Mira. Madame Shetland looked at her and raised one eyebrow. Miss Glitterhorn handed her the scroll. Miras heart was hammering in her chest. Everyone in the crowd turned towards the double doors. But there was no sign of her unicorn yet. Mira looked back down at her scroll. She could see the word beginning to form. It wasnt long enough to be Princess Delilah Sparklehoof, but the first letter was a D . . . Dancer? Dasher? DESTINY? A surprised sort of gasp echoed around the hall. Mira peered closer at the scroll. It definitely said Dave. Again the heads turned towards the door . . . Again there was no unicorn. Madame Shetland looked over at Miss Glitterhorn, who said, Just a sec, and jogged over to the double doors. She started clicking and waving at something outside. But whatever was being clicked and waved at didnt seem to want to come in. Eventually Madame Shetland went over to help and between them they pushed in the smallest, plumpest unicorn Mira had ever seen. He had his bottom planted firmly on the ground and was making it as difficult as possible for the two teachers to move him. Mira stared. He had a little pot belly and a mane like straw that stuck up at odd angles. Greet your unicorn, dear, said Madame Shetland, giving a slightly forced smile. Miss Glitterhorn was leaning against the mounting block and sweating. Hi . . . Dave, said Mira. The unicorn looked up at her. Okay, so he was a bit small. And he wasnt very glittery. But at least I have a unicorn! she thought. Mira reached out to pat his nose and Dave snorted loudly and put his ears back. She pulled her hand away. A round of applause for our final pair, Mira and Dave! said Madame Shetland. Uncertain claps rippled around the hall. Miras sister was laughing so hard that she had to be taken outside. Mira looked back at her unicorn. There was a twinkle in Daves eye. Mira felt encouraged. She smiled and waved at the crowd. Dave snorted again and lifted his tail. Then he unleashed a giant heap of poo onto Miss Glitterhorns feet. CHAPTER FOUR Daves Doughnuts It took Mira a while to get from assembly to her first lesson, as Dave had sat down again in the corridor and was refusing to move. But Raheem came to help her and together they half-dragged, half-pushed Dave down the hallway on his bottom and towards the classroom. Unicorn School was certainly full of surprises. And challenges. Right now, Dave was being quite a challenge, but Mira was sure they would have a magical time as soon as they got to class. Miss Glitterhorn tutted when they finally arrived. She was standing in front of the whiteboard, cleaning Daves poo off her shoes with a wet wipe. As I was saying, Class Red, School Rule Number 19 is Be On Time, Every Time. Mira gasped. The double desks were like normal desks on one side, but on the other there was a taller, unicorn-sized desk with a bag of hay hanging off it. Underneath each unicorns desk was a basket containing grooming equipment. Raheem scurried over to sit at the desk right at the front where Brave was standing proudly. There was one empty double desk. Dave plodded towards it, behind Mira, and gave a snort. Then he finished off his entire hay bag in two bites.

 **(Sound of playful, whimsical music fades in and then fades slightly to background level)**

**Joe:** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Podify Kids, the podcast that’s more fun than a unicorn bouncy castle!

**Sarah:**  Hee hee!  That's a great one, Joe! And speaking of unicorns, remember Mira and Dave from last time?  Poor Miss Glitterhorn!  Covered in… well, you know!

**Joe:**  Yep!  And Dave, the surprisingly un-glittery, poo-producing unicorn!  But remember, even the silliest unicorns can be amazing friends!  Today, we’re diving into Dave's Doughnuts… or should I say, Dave’s *challenges*!

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  Remember, kids, even if things don't go exactly as planned, it’s all part of the adventure!  Like trying to get a stubborn unicorn to class on time!  It's like trying to get your little brother to eat his broccoli – a real challenge!

**(Sound of a playful "boing!")**

**Joe:**  That's a perfect analogy, Sarah!  So, imagine this: You're Mira, and you have to get Dave to class.  He's refusing to budge! What's your super-duper plan?

**(Pause for a moment to let kids imagine)**

**Sarah:**  Ooh, maybe I'd offer Dave a delicious carrot bribe!  Or maybe… a giant pile of sparkly hay!  Unicorns love sparkly things, right?

**Joe:**  Brilliant!  And what if the carrot and sparkly hay don't work?  What's your backup plan?

**Sarah:**  Hmmm… maybe I’d sing him a song!  A super silly unicorn song!  Or maybe I'd build him a tiny, comfy ramp to roll down to class!  That would be a hilarious sight!

**Joe:**  High five!  That's some creative problem-solving!  Remember kids, never give up!  Persistence is key, even when dealing with a particularly… *determined* unicorn.

**(Sound of a gentle chime)**

**Joe:**  Now for a quick trivia question! What's School Rule Number 19 in Unicorn School?

**Sarah:** That's right!  It's "Be On Time, Every Time!"  And Dave definitely broke that rule!  He's still learning the ropes!

**Joe:**  Exactly!  And that's okay!  Learning is all about making mistakes and having fun along the way. Even if those mistakes involve a little… you know… *unicorn fertilizer*.

Joe: Theyd made it! Mira gave a happy sigh as she sat down at her desk. Miss Glitterhorn finished running through the School Rules (Mira definitely heard at least some of them) and stood up from behind her desk. Now you have your unicorn, she said, the lessons can begin. We will have two days of lessons, where you will learn all about Unicorn School, and how we look after the land. But, most importantly, you will bond with your unicorns so that on day three, you will be ready to go on your first magical quest. The class oohed and aahed, and there was a buzz of excitement. Mira looked around the room and noticed that Jake and Pegasus were their neighbours. She gave Jake a friendly smile but he was looking at Dave with a disgusted Daves Doughnuts expression on his face. She turned and saw that Dave was gnawing at the corner of the desk. She hoped Miss Glitterhorn wouldnt notice. Right! said Miss Glitterhorn. Lesson one is Getting to Know your Unicorn. You and your unicorn have a very special bond. You were chosen for each other by the purest kind of magic: friendship. But youve only just met and you must earn your unicorns trust. First, grooming. This is very relaxing for unicorns. Pick up your brushes and off you go! Mira picked up a soft brush. Shed read all about grooming. She reached out to put the brush on Daves back and he ducked, avoiding her hand, and side-stepped out of the way. Mira stepped closer to him and tried again but he just did the same thing. Then she tried a different brush but he sidestepped again. They kept doing this and shuffling further and further away from their desk until a girl called Tamsin put her hand up to say that they were making her unicorn feel uncomfortable. Mira dragged Dave back to their desk. She tried hiding the brush behind her back, she tried attaching it to a stick. She even tried brushing herself to show him how nice it was, until Miss Glitterhorn came over to ask what she was doing. Then, hoping to put him in a better mood, Mira gave Dave the unicorn crown Daves Doughnuts shed made for him. Dave looked at the crown thoughtfully for a moment and then he ate it. Mira suddenly had a brilliant idea. Dave must be hungry! Thats why he wasnt paying attention! Mira remembered Miss Glitterhorn saying Treating is Cheating (Unicorn School Rule 54) and You Must Not Bribe Your Unicorn (Unicorn School Rule 3), but this was tending to Daves needs. She was looking after him! She reached into her bag for the treats shed bought with Mum earlier. But the shopping bag was full of doughnuts, not carrots! Mira realized she must have picked up her mums bag by mistake . . . now Dave didnt have ANY treats. (And mum had taken a bag of carrots to work with her.) Mira could feel her eyes welling up with tears as she dropped the doughnuts on the floor. NOTHING was going right today. But something extraordinary was happening to Dave. His nostrils flared and his mouth twitched. With a happy little whinny he gobbled up a doughnut, then another and, before Mira could stop him, he had eaten them all AND the bag. Suddenly, Dave was like a different unicorn. His eyes shone and his mane even looked swishy. He let Mira stroke his soft muzzle and then he stamped a hoof in joy. Mira grabbed a brush and started combing it through his mane. She looked around the room, fizzing with pride. She hoped everyone would see how happy Dave suddenly was he was showing his teeth in a sort of weird grin. He must really like doughnuts, she thought. Maybe she would win a medal for Best at Cheering Up Unicorns! Then it all went wrong. Dave reared up on his hind legs and let out a loud and gleeful neigh. He shot forwards, knocking over a chair. A few children and unicorns turned towards them, startled, and Miss Glitterhorn looked up from her desk.

**Joe:** Hey kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids! I’m Joe!

**Sarah:** And I’m Sarah!  Ready for another amazing adventure?

**Joe:** You bet! Last time, Mira was having a *bit* of a tough time bonding with her unicorn, Dave. Remember, Dave had a serious doughnut addiction!

**Sarah:**  (Laughing)  A doughnut addiction!  That's one way to put it!  He wasn't exactly cooperating with the grooming lesson, was he?

**Joe:** Nope!  He was dodging brushes like a pro!  But then, Mira had a brilliant idea… although it involved a bag full of *doughnuts* instead of carrots!

**Sarah:** Oh dear!  That's a bit of a mishap!  I wonder what happened next?  Kids, let's imagine this: you’re at Unicorn School.  What would *you* do if your unicorn only wanted doughnuts?

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music interlude)**

**Joe:**  (Excitedly)  And then, the most amazing thing happened! Dave ate all the doughnuts… and suddenly, he was a completely different unicorn! He let Mira brush him, and even gave her a happy grin!

**Sarah:** Wow!  It seems like sometimes, even unicorns need a little sugar rush to get in the mood for grooming! But remember kids, carrots are much healthier for unicorns!  Maybe even apples or some yummy unicorn-approved hay!

**Joe:**  Exactly!  But it wasn't all smooth sailing! Dave got a little *too* excited and knocked over a chair!  Oops!

**Sarah:**  (Giggles)  Sounds like Dave needed to learn a bit of unicorn etiquette!  Here's a fun fact: did you know that unicorns are known for their grace and gentleness?  But even the gentlest unicorn can get a little bouncy sometimes!

**Joe:**  That’s right!  And now, a quick trivia question for our super listeners!  What is the name of the school Mira is attending?

**(Short pause for children to guess)**

**Sarah:** That's right! It's Unicorn School!  And it sounds like Mira and Dave are in for a wild ride!

**Joe:**  Absolutely!  We'll find out what happens next time on Podify Kids!  Don’t forget to tell us about your own amazing adventures on our website!

**Sarah:** And don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical stories! Until next time, stay curious and keep exploring!

Sarah: Then, full of sugary, doughnutty joy, Dave galloped around the classroom, scattering the pupils and their unicorns and destroying the matchstick fairytale castle that Grace Hobbs had brought in as a present for her unicorn and had taken literally weeks to make. Finally, he skidded into Jakes desk and crushed his pencil case. Jake looked furious. After Miss Glitterhorn had wrangled Dave into Daves Doughnuts the Naughty Stall, she announced that since most pupils had successfully groomed their unicorns, the class would now be creating pieces of art together. She suggested that Mira use the time to read the rule book, paying special attention to Unicorn School Rule 79: No Havoc Indoors. Thats one Havoc Point already, Im afraid. Three Havoc Points will result in detention, she said. Then, that pupil and their unicorn will not be able to attend the first quest. Mira felt a panicky feeling in her stomach. She couldnt miss out on the first quest! She snuck a look at Dave over her shoulder and saw that he was happily snoozing in the Naughty Stall. He looked very sweet. But she couldnt quite ignore the thought she kept pushing to the back of her mind. What if they didnt have a totally magical bond? What if Dave wasnt going to be her unicorn best friend? CHAPTER FIVE History Comes Alive . . . After a good nights sleep in Red Dormitory, Mira woke up feeling full of hope for the day ahead. She picked Dave up from his stable and gave him a little pep talk on the way to class. At least he was walking alongside her today. Mira felt that was progress. I know it feels different, being in school now, like a big unicorn. But well get through it together! I know we can be best friends! Dave gave Mira a sideways glance and then did a long, rumbling fart. The first lesson of the day was History of the Unicorn and their teacher, Mr Trotsky, was giving a lecture on famous unicorns of the last thousand years. Mira lost concentration a couple of times, first when another class rode their unicorns past the window and then when Darcy passed round a note saying Would you rather have a unicorn that could breathe fire or one that had electric hooves? And Mr Trotsky did have a slow, droney voice. I hope youve been taking notes, class, Mr Trotsky said, after talking for a very long time. We have another five hundred years of unicorns to get through after our break and then you will each prepare a presentation about a famous unicorn from history, to be performed at the end of the day. Lets make history come alive! After break time Dave trotted over to the grooming basket under their desk. With his front hoof, he knocked everything out of the basket, lay down in it and went to sleep. Mira looked around at the other unicorns who were sitting up nicely at their desks. Some were even helping to take notes. Sebs unicorn, Firework, seemed to be sketching with his horn. Im sure Dave can do that too . . . when hes awake, thought Mira. She smiled and picked out different coloured pens to underline her notes. That cheered her up even more. Top Five Best Unicorns from History Unicornardo da Vinci painter and inventor King Henry the Neighth very fat unicorn who had six wives Winst-horn Churchill unicorn prime minister during the war Queen Boudiccorn the most magnificent Celtic warrior queen unicorn King Arth-horn and the Unicorns of the Round Stable.

Speaker Joe should End the podcast by saying this: Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!

**Joe:** Hey there, super-duper kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids, the podcast that’s more fun than a unicorn bouncy castle!

**Sarah:**  Hee hee! That’s a great one, Joe!  Today, we’re diving headfirst into the amazing world of…unicorns!

**Joe:**  Woohoo!  And not just any unicorns, Sarah, but *historical* unicorns!  Did you know unicorns weren't just sparkly legends?  They've been part of history for ages!

**Sarah:**  Really? Like, *real* history?  Like, with kings and queens and… battles?!

**Joe:** Exactly!  Imagine a unicorn knight, galloping into battle with a shining horn!  Or a unicorn queen ruling a kingdom with magical wisdom!

**Sarah:** Whoa!  Okay, I’m imagining a unicorn queen wearing a sparkly crown and riding a fluffy, rainbow-colored cloud!

**Joe:**  Awesome! That’s the spirit! Now, let's talk about some famous historical unicorns.  Sarah, tell us about one!

**Sarah:** Okay! How about Unicornardo da Vinci?  That’s a super cool name!  He was a painter and inventor, just like the real Leonardo da Vinci!  Maybe he invented unicorn-powered paintbrushes!

**Joe:**  Maybe he painted self-portraits with his horn!  Or invented a machine that made rainbow sprinkles for unicorn cakes!  We can only imagine!

**(Sound of a playful horn toot)**

**Joe:**  Now for a quick trivia question!  Which famous historical unicorn was a prime minister?

**Sarah:**  Hmm… was it… Winst-horn Churchill?!

**Joe:** That's right!  Winst-horn Churchill, the unicorn prime minister!  Just like the real Winston Churchill, but with a horn and maybe a love for carrots instead of cigars!

**Sarah:**  I bet he had amazing unicorn speeches!  Imagine a unicorn giving a speech… with a super-powerful, magical voice!

**Joe:**  Exactly! Now, let’s imagine this: You’re a historian studying unicorns. What’s the most amazing unicorn fact you’ve discovered?

**(Pause for kids to think)**

**Sarah:**  I’d discovered that unicorns could talk to animals and understand their secret languages!  They could translate squirrel gossip and decipher the songs of whales!

**Joe:** That's incredible, Sarah!  And you know what?  It just goes to show how much more there is to learn about the amazing world of unicorns, and the world around us!


**(Sound of upbeat music fades in)**

**Joe:** Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Sarah: Hey everyone!  It's Sarah here, ready to join Joe on this super magical adventure to Unicorn School!  Joe, tell us more about Mira's exciting first day!
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I'd totally bring a tiny dragon!  But it would have to be a really well-behaved one, of course,  no fire-breathing in class!  So, Joe, what's this Magic Portal Mira's going to use? Is it like a rainbow slide?
[INFO] Joe: Woohoo!  So, Mira's super excited because today's not just the first day of her holidays, it's her first day at Unicorn School! Can you believe it?  Imagine getting to go to a school where your classmates are unicorns!  What kind of pet would YOU want to take to school if you could?  A fluffy bunny?  A skateboarding hamster? Let us know in the comments!
[INFO] Joe: Even better!  It's a secret!  But it sounds pretty amazing, right?  Before she goes, Mira and Rani are at the supermarket getting treats for their unicorns!  Now, this is a tricky one for our listeners – what do YOU think unicorns might like to eat?  Is it rainbow sprinkles?  Magic mushrooms?  Sparkly carrots?
[INFO] Sarah: Ooh, I bet they love rainbow sprinkles! And maybe some glittery apples!  But what about the School Rules? Joe, what are the Unicorn School rules like?  Are there any rules we can guess?
[INFO] Joe: Great question, Sarah! That’s what makes this so fun!  We don't know all the rules yet, but I bet there's a rule about no kicking other unicorns. And probably a rule about no using magic to cheat on tests! And maybe one about always being kind to your unicorn! What other rules do you think there are at Unicorn School? Let's hear your ideas!
[INFO] Sarah: I bet there's a rule about brushing your unicorn's mane every day! And maybe one about sharing your sparkly treats!  This is so exciting!  I can't wait to hear what happens next!
[INFO] Joe: Me neither!  Mira's already dreaming about her unicorn, Princess Delilah Sparklehoof, and all the amazing adventures they'll have together!  Remember kids,  always believe in magic and never stop dreaming!  We'll be back after a quick break with more from Mira's incredible first day at Unicorn School!  Don't forget to subscribe and share Podify Kids with your friends!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, podcast adventurers! Welcome back to Podify Kids!  I'm Joe!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And I'm Sarah!  And boy, oh boy, did Mira have a surprise waiting for her at Unicorn School! Remember Rani, Mira's older sister, who’s *supposed* to be helping her?
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah!  Last time, Mira and Rani were ready to go through the Magic Portal… but things didn't quite go as planned!  Remember kids, sometimes even magic needs a little bit of… well, let's just say *unpredictability*!
[INFO] Joe: **  Ha!  Can you imagine?  A magic portal disguised as… a wheelie bin? That's some serious sisterly mischief!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  Rani, being the *hilarious* older sister she is, played a little trick on Mira! Instead of a magical portal, Mira found herself… well, let's just say she had a *very* smelly encounter with a wheelie bin!
[INFO] Sarah: **  It is! And poor Mira, after leaping out of the bin with a mighty yell, she bumped into Raheem and his dad! They were waiting to go through the *real* magic portal!
[INFO] Joe: **  Oh no!  A case of mistaken identity!  This sounds like the start of a fantastic new friendship!  Kids, have you ever had a funny misunderstanding with a friend? Tell us about it!
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Mira, feeling a little bit embarrassed but also super excited, explains that it's her first day too.  Raheem's dad, super nice guy, decides to show her the *actual* Magic Portal!
[INFO] Joe: **  Imagine this, kids! You’re about to go to a magical school, but first, you have to find a hidden portal! Where do you think the *real* portal might be hidden? Is it behind a giant mushroom? Inside a talking tree?  Let your imagination run wild!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly! It turns out, the portal wasn't hidden in a wheelie bin at all but was cleverly concealed behind a clump of bushes!  Who would have guessed?!
[INFO] Joe: **  See? Sometimes magic is all about looking in the right places!  That’s a great lesson for everyone, even grown-ups!  It's like searching for your favorite toy – sometimes it’s hiding in plain sight!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And that's where our adventure ends for today, kids! But don't worry, we'll be back next time to see what amazing adventures await Mira at Unicorn School! Don't forget to subscribe and share Podify Kids with your friends!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids! I'm Joe!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And I'm Sarah!  And boy, oh boy, do we have an exciting episode for you today! We're continuing Mira's amazing adventure at Unicorn School! Remember all those sparkly rainbows and the super-fast flight?
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah!  Last time, Mira and Raheem arrived at Unicorn School – and wow, was it HUGE!  It was like a magical castle-bungalow! Remember, Sarah, why it's a bungalow?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Because unicorns don't like stairs!  Clever unicorns!  So, they zoomed through the rainbow and landed in the Grand Paddock – which is basically the unicorn playground!  And guess what they saw?
[INFO] Joe: ** REAL LIVE UNICORNS!!! Can you imagine?! Unicorns playing football on their unicorns!  That's like playing soccer on a bouncy castle, but way cooler!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And some unicorns were even jumping!  It looked like they were flying!  Mira learned that as unicorns get older, they develop magical powers – some can even FLY!  Isn't that incredible?
[INFO] Joe: ** It's like learning to ride a bike, but instead of a bike, it's a magical unicorn, and instead of falling, you might just start flying!  Who wants to learn to fly on a unicorn?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  And Mira saw Rani and her friends! Remember Rani?  She's in Class Yellow!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's right!  They start in Class Red, then move up through all the colors of the rainbow!  Each year, they get a new stripe on their badge!  Like a rainbow progress report!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Here's a fun question for you, listeners!  If Mira starts in Class Red and moves up through the rainbow, what color class will she be in after Yellow?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's right, Green!  Good job, everyone!  And guess what? Mira is about to meet her very own unicorn!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Isn't that exciting?  Imagine meeting your own personal unicorn! What would you name your unicorn?  Let us know in the comments!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's all for today, kids!  Join us next time to find out what happens when Mira meets her unicorn!  Don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical adventures!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super-duper kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And guess what? We're diving headfirst into a world of magic, friendship, and…unicorns!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's right, Sarah! Last time, we left Mira just about to meet her very own unicorn at Unicorn School! Can you believe it?!
[INFO] Sarah: ** I know! It's so exciting!  Imagine getting your very own unicorn – it's like getting a fluffy, sparkly, magical best friend!
[INFO] Joe: **  Speaking of magical, let's recap! Remember, Mira's in Class Red, the only human class, and she's about to meet her unicorn at a super special assembly!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And she's with her sister, Raheem, and her new friend, Darcy, who thinks she'll be famous one day!  Maybe a unicorn-themed talent show?
[INFO] Joe: ** Ooh, that's a great idea!  Okay, kids, imagine this:  You're at Unicorn School. What's the first thing you'd do?  Would you try to brush your unicorn's magnificent mane?  Would you race it across the sparkly paddock? Let us know in the comments!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And here's a fun fact!  Did you know that unicorns are often described as having a horn that spirals? It's like a magical corkscrew!  Imagine trying to untwist it!  It would probably be super ticklish!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's a great one, Sarah!  Here's a riddle for you all: I have a mane but no hair, a horn but no head. What am I?
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's right! A unicorn!  Way to go, brainy kids!
[INFO] Joe: ** Now, back to Mira!  Remember Madame Shetland, the headmistress? She's about to explain something super important about the bond between humans and unicorns.  It's like a special friendship, stronger than any other!
[INFO] Sarah: **  It's like the bond between you and your best friend, only with a bit more magic and a lot more sparkles!
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly!  And guess what? We’ll find out all about it in our next episode! So, don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical adventures!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, Podcast Pals! Welcome back to Podify Kids!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Heeey!  Ready for another amazing adventure?
[INFO] Joe: ** You bet! Last time, we left Mira and her friends about to meet their unicorns at Unicorn School! Remember that incredible, sparkly, magical place?
[INFO] Sarah: ** Oh my gosh, yes!  It sounded like a dream!  So, what happened next?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well,  one by one, the kids got their unicorn partners!  Jake, the aspiring showjumper, got a majestic purple unicorn named Pegasus! Can you imagine riding a unicorn that's the color of a juicy plum?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Wow!  A purple plum unicorn! That's amazing! I bet Pegasus can jump really high!
[INFO] Joe: **  Probably higher than a giraffe on a trampoline!  Then Darcy, who loves taking selfies (until her phone got confiscated!), got a super-shiny silver unicorn.  And Seb, the art lover, got a unicorn with a rainbow mane named Firework!  Can you picture that?
[INFO] Sarah: ** A rainbow mane! That’s like a walking, talking rainbow!  So colorful!  Okay, Joe, quick question for our listeners! What do you think Raheem, who loves books, got for a unicorn? A unicorn that loves reading? A unicorn that writes poems?
[INFO] Joe: **  Great question, Sarah!  Let's see what our listeners think!  Maybe they can email us their guesses!  And guess what happened next?  When it was Raheem's turn... BOOM!  The ground shook, and a HUGE midnight-blue unicorn galloped in! The biggest one they'd ever seen!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Whoa! That sounds like a super-powered unicorn!  Like a superhero unicorn!  What do you think its superpower is, Joe?  Super speed?  Super strength?  Super reading?
[INFO] Joe: **  Maybe all three! It was so fast, it was a blur!  And it was SO big! Imagine a unicorn so tall it could peek over the tallest building in your city!
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's incredible!  I wish I could see that unicorn!  Okay, kids, imagine this: You're at Unicorn School too! What kind of unicorn would YOU want, and what would you name it?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a fantastic question, Sarah!  Tell us your dream unicorn on our website! We’d love to hear all about it!  And don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical adventures!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Podify Kids, the podcast that’s more fun than a unicorn bouncy castle!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hee hee!  That's a great one, Joe! And speaking of unicorns, remember Mira and Dave from last time?  Poor Miss Glitterhorn!  Covered in… well, you know!
[INFO] Joe: **  Yep!  And Dave, the surprisingly un-glittery, poo-producing unicorn!  But remember, even the silliest unicorns can be amazing friends!  Today, we’re diving into Dave's Doughnuts… or should I say, Dave’s *challenges*!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  Remember, kids, even if things don't go exactly as planned, it’s all part of the adventure!  Like trying to get a stubborn unicorn to class on time!  It's like trying to get your little brother to eat his broccoli – a real challenge!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's a perfect analogy, Sarah!  So, imagine this: You're Mira, and you have to get Dave to class.  He's refusing to budge! What's your super-duper plan?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Ooh, maybe I'd offer Dave a delicious carrot bribe!  Or maybe… a giant pile of sparkly hay!  Unicorns love sparkly things, right?
[INFO] Joe: **  Brilliant!  And what if the carrot and sparkly hay don't work?  What's your backup plan?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hmmm… maybe I’d sing him a song!  A super silly unicorn song!  Or maybe I'd build him a tiny, comfy ramp to roll down to class!  That would be a hilarious sight!
[INFO] Joe: **  High five!  That's some creative problem-solving!  Remember kids, never give up!  Persistence is key, even when dealing with a particularly… *determined* unicorn.
[INFO] Joe: **  Now for a quick trivia question! What's School Rule Number 19 in Unicorn School?
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's right!  It's "Be On Time, Every Time!"  And Dave definitely broke that rule!  He's still learning the ropes!
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly!  And that's okay!  Learning is all about making mistakes and having fun along the way. Even if those mistakes involve a little… you know… *unicorn fertilizer*.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So kids, what are some challenges YOU face sometimes?  Maybe it's sharing toys, or learning a new skill, or even just getting ready for school on time!
[INFO] Joe: **  Let us know on our website!  Tell us about your own amazing adventures, and don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical stories!  Until next time, stay curious and keep exploring!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids! I’m Joe!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And I’m Sarah!  Ready for another amazing adventure?
[INFO] Joe: ** You bet! Last time, Mira was having a *bit* of a tough time bonding with her unicorn, Dave. Remember, Dave had a serious doughnut addiction!
[INFO] Sarah: **  (Laughing)  A doughnut addiction!  That's one way to put it!  He wasn't exactly cooperating with the grooming lesson, was he?
[INFO] Joe: ** Nope!  He was dodging brushes like a pro!  But then, Mira had a brilliant idea… although it involved a bag full of *doughnuts* instead of carrots!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Oh dear!  That's a bit of a mishap!  I wonder what happened next?  Kids, let's imagine this: you’re at Unicorn School.  What would *you* do if your unicorn only wanted doughnuts?
[INFO] Joe: **  (Excitedly)  And then, the most amazing thing happened! Dave ate all the doughnuts… and suddenly, he was a completely different unicorn! He let Mira brush him, and even gave her a happy grin!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Wow!  It seems like sometimes, even unicorns need a little sugar rush to get in the mood for grooming! But remember kids, carrots are much healthier for unicorns!  Maybe even apples or some yummy unicorn-approved hay!
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly!  But it wasn't all smooth sailing! Dave got a little *too* excited and knocked over a chair!  Oops!
[INFO] Sarah: **  (Giggles)  Sounds like Dave needed to learn a bit of unicorn etiquette!  Here's a fun fact: did you know that unicorns are known for their grace and gentleness?  But even the gentlest unicorn can get a little bouncy sometimes!
[INFO] Joe: **  That’s right!  And now, a quick trivia question for our super listeners!  What is the name of the school Mira is attending?
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's right! It's Unicorn School!  And it sounds like Mira and Dave are in for a wild ride!
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely!  We'll find out what happens next time on Podify Kids!  Don’t forget to tell us about your own amazing adventures on our website!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And don't forget to subscribe to Podify Kids for more magical stories! Until next time, stay curious and keep exploring!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super-duper kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids, the podcast that’s more fun than a unicorn bouncy castle!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hee hee! That’s a great one, Joe!  Today, we’re diving headfirst into the amazing world of…unicorns!
[INFO] Joe: **  Woohoo!  And not just any unicorns, Sarah, but *historical* unicorns!  Did you know unicorns weren't just sparkly legends?  They've been part of history for ages!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Really? Like, *real* history?  Like, with kings and queens and… battles?!
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly!  Imagine a unicorn knight, galloping into battle with a shining horn!  Or a unicorn queen ruling a kingdom with magical wisdom!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Whoa!  Okay, I’m imagining a unicorn queen wearing a sparkly crown and riding a fluffy, rainbow-colored cloud!
[INFO] Joe: **  Awesome! That’s the spirit! Now, let's talk about some famous historical unicorns.  Sarah, tell us about one!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay! How about Unicornardo da Vinci?  That’s a super cool name!  He was a painter and inventor, just like the real Leonardo da Vinci!  Maybe he invented unicorn-powered paintbrushes!
[INFO] Joe: **  Maybe he painted self-portraits with his horn!  Or invented a machine that made rainbow sprinkles for unicorn cakes!  We can only imagine!
[INFO] Joe: **  Now for a quick trivia question!  Which famous historical unicorn was a prime minister?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hmm… was it… Winst-horn Churchill?!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's right!  Winst-horn Churchill, the unicorn prime minister!  Just like the real Winston Churchill, but with a horn and maybe a love for carrots instead of cigars!
[INFO] Sarah: **  I bet he had amazing unicorn speeches!  Imagine a unicorn giving a speech… with a super-powerful, magical voice!
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly! Now, let’s imagine this: You’re a historian studying unicorns. What’s the most amazing unicorn fact you’ve discovered?
[INFO] Sarah: **  I’d discovered that unicorns could talk to animals and understand their secret languages!  They could translate squirrel gossip and decipher the songs of whales!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's incredible, Sarah!  And you know what?  It just goes to show how much more there is to learn about the amazing world of unicorns, and the world around us!
[INFO] Joe: ** Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!

Joe: CHAPTER ONE Magic Monday It was Monday morning and Mira Desai was VERY excited. This was no ordinary Monday morning. This Monday morning was the first day of the holidays AND it was Miras first day at a new school! Because this was no ordinary school . . . this was: Mira had been desperate to go to Unicorn School since her sister Rani started going two summers ago. Rani wouldnt stop going on about how wonderful her unicorn (Angelica) was. She kept saying how amazing she was at all the magical quests. And she was always making whinnying noises in Miras ear to make her jealous. AND shed brought home about a hundred Unicorn School quest medals, which had their own special shelf in the living room. Rani said that quests could go on for days and days and were super exciting. And the time Rani spent at Unicorn School did seem like ages to Mira. But time passed differently at Unicorn School, and Rani was really only ever gone for a day in normal time. Mira had dreamed of having her own unicorn since FOREVER. She practised plaiting the manes and tails of all her toy horses, persuaded her dad to let her groom his beard and even tried attaching a horn to their cat, Pickles. He wasnt very pleased. It was a bit of a mystery who was selected to go to Unicorn School and who wasnt. Lots of people from Miras family had gone to Unicorn School, including Miras mum, so Mira hoped more than anything that she would get to go, too. Mira always tried to live her life as open to magic as possible. She wished on stars, she believed in fairies, she said hello to black cats who crossed her path. And then, one incredible day, Mira woke up with a sparkly envelope on her pillow. Mira remembered it as if it was yesterday. (It was actually last Thursday.) She screamed so loudly that Pickles flung himself off Miras bed into a pile of dirty clothes, and Miras dad came running in to check what was wrong. But there was nothing wrong. Everything was finally right. Her hands shaking with excitement, Mira opened the letter: Dear Mira Desai, We are delighted to invite you to join us at Unicorn School. You will be in Class RED. Please use the Magic Portal to access the school. We look forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely, Madame Shetland DAD! Mira yelled and started jumping on the bed. IM GOING TO UNICORN SCHOOL! Terrified, Pickles jumped on to Miras dads face and wouldnt let go of his beard. Mfmfmfmf! he said cheerfully and gave Mira a thumbs up, before leaving the room and walking into the wall. Mira reached inside the envelope and pulled out a leaflet containing all the information about the school, including a map and the School Rules. Mira thought she might faint with delight. Unicorn School was going to be BRILLIANT! For one thing, Mira couldnt WAIT to bring home her own medals. Shed already started making a space for them on the shelf (and had accidentally knocked a couple of Ranis medals into Pickless bowl). But the thing Mira was MOST excited about was getting to meet her unicorn. Her sister said that the unicorns were specially chosen for each person for specific magical reasons. You would get to spend all day every day with your unicorn: going to lessons, working on projects and going on quests. (Basically your unicorn would be your best friend.) Mira did have a best friend already at normal school (Katie with a K) but she could definitely squeeze another one into her life. Shed spent a lot of time thinking about her dream unicorn best friend (Princess Delilah Sparklehoof). Shed filled a whole notebook with drawings of her and made a list of all the brilliant things they would do together. 1. Have amazing, magical adventures! 2. Be great at quests 3. Get LOADS OF MEDALS Before heading to the Magic Portal that would take them to Unicorn School, Miras mum took them to the supermarket. Mira and Rani needed to get treats for their unicorns and Mum needed to buy doughnuts for someones birthday at work. Mira was wondering what treats unicorns like.

 Sarah: Wow, Joe! That’s an amazing start to Mira’s adventure!  Unicorn School sounds incredibly magical!  I bet *I* would love to go to Unicorn School!  So, Joe, what kind of treats do you think unicorns would like?  Do they like sparkly donuts like the ones Mira's mum is buying? Or maybe rainbow-colored carrots?

Joe:  That's a super question, Sarah!  I think sparkly donuts would be a HUGE hit! Unicorns are magical, so they probably love sparkly things! But maybe they also have a taste for things from nature, like magical rainbow carrots that grant wishes, or maybe shimmering apples that make you fly!  What do *you* think they'd like, kids listening at home?  Maybe send us an email or leave a comment telling us your unicorn treat ideas!

Sarah: Ooh, I like the idea of wishing carrots!  And flying apples sound amazing!  Speaking of amazing, Joe, how does this Magic Portal work? Is it like a wardrobe that leads to Narnia?  Or maybe a sparkly door that plays twinkle-twinkle little star when you open it?

Joe:  Great question, Sarah!  It's a bit of a mystery, isn't it?  The story doesn't tell us exactly how it works, which makes it even more exciting!  Maybe it's a swirling vortex of rainbow colours? Or perhaps it's hidden behind a waterfall, only visible to those who believe in magic!  Imagine this, kids: you're standing in front of the portal. What does it look like?  Use your imaginations and draw a picture of the Magic Portal!

Sarah:  I think mine would be a shimmering pool of water, with little sparkles dancing on the surface.  And when you step in, it feels like you’re floating on a cloud!  Okay, Joe, before Mira gets to Unicorn School, let’s have a quick quiz for our listeners!

Joe:  I love quizzes!  Okay, here’s one:  What did Mira try to attach to Pickles the cat?  Was it A) a sparkly hat, B) a unicorn horn, or C) a pair of rainbow wings?

Sarah:  That’s a tricky one!  Kids, shout out your answer!  I think I know the answer…

Joe: You’re right, Sarah! The answer is B, a unicorn horn!  Poor Pickles!  Let’s see what other magical adventures await Mira at Unicorn School!  Coming up next, we'll find out what happens when Mira and Rani get to the supermarket and choose their unicorn treats!  Stay tuned, kids!

Sarah: Which aisle do you go to for magic treats? she thought to herself. But when she asked her sister Rani rolled her eyes and said, Unicorns like carrots, obviously. And so they all headed over to the vegetable aisle. When theyd bought their carrots they went back to the car. Rani also had some hay left over from last term and Mum thought it would be nice if she shared it with Mira. The Magic Portal was in the car park by the leisure centre. Mira had never actually seen it the portal could only be seen by current Unicorn School pupils. Even Miras mum couldnt see it any more, since she had left Unicorn School roughly a thousand years ago. Usually when they dropped her off, Rani got out round the corner so that she wouldnt be seen with them. But TODAY Mira would be going with her. And she would be one step closer to meeting her unicorn! There had been quite a bit of traffic on the way and Mum was running late for work. Its okay, Mum, said Rani. Ill take Mira through. Mum looked from one sister to the other and then at her watch. Fine, she said. And then she fixed Rani with a LOOK. Make sure you take care of your little sister on her first day. Mum handed them their treat bags, gave them both a hug and jumped back in the car. Rani had already started stomping off when Mum rolled down her window. She leaned out with her phone in hand. Girls! Let me take a picture. Your first day at Unicorn School together! Rani turned, tutted and folded her arms. MUM, are you crying? Thats so embarrassing. Mum sniffed. It brings back such amazing memories of MY first day at Unicorn School! Oh, happy times . . . Their mum stared off into the distance for a moment, before she smiled again and blew her nose. Now, smile girls! Rani rolled her eyes. Mira smiled and gave two thumbs up as Mums phone camera CLICKED. Love you, girls. Have fun! Mum drove off, waving one hand at them out of the window as she left the car park. Mira felt a bit nervous. Wheres the Magic Portal? she asked Rani. Over here, said her sister. Come on. Rani stopped by the wheelie bins in the corner of the car park. So you have to get in the bin, spin round three times and then jump out and scream. Then youll be at Unicorn School, she said. Mira looked up at the bin. Are you sure? she said. Er, which one of us has a medal for being the Best at the Magic Portal? said her sister. Okay . . . said Mira. Mira clambered into the bin and held her breath. This was SO exciting! (Also, it really stank.) In just a few seconds shed be in Unicorn School . . . CHAPTER TWO Through the Portal Mira leaped out of the bin, yelling at the top of her voice. AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGH! came the reply, as she collided with someone. Mira looked down to see a boy on the ground, staring up at her with wide eyes. Behind him was a man cowering by a bike rack. Oh, hello! said Mira, as she helped the boy up. Sorry about that. The boy stared at her warily. So this is Unicorn School, she said, looking around. To be honest, it didnt look very different to the leisure centre car park. Uh no, said the man by the bike racks. Mira supposed he must be the boys dad because they looked quite alike and had matching briefcases. This is where you go through the Magic Portal to get to the school. Raheem is just about to go through. He gestured at the boy, who gulped. But said Mira, as she looked around for her sister who was nowhere to be seen. And then she realized Rani had tricked her and gone through on her own! TYPICAL. We can show you if you like? said Raheems dad. Its Raheems first day. Weve had twelve practice runs, just to be safe. He squeezed Raheems shoulder. Do . . . do you live in that bin? squeaked Raheem. No! I was just . . . resting there before I went through the portal, said Mira. Its my first day too Im Mira. It would be brilliant if you could show me. She followed the two of them past the bins and to a little clump of bushes at the edge of the car park.

 **(Sound of playful, whimsical music fades in and then fades slightly to background level)**

**Joe:** Hey there, super listeners! Welcome back to "Adventures with Joe and Sarah"!  Last time, we left Mira just about to enter Unicorn School!  But wait… something unexpected happened!

**Sarah:**  Something *totally* unexpected, Joe!  Mira thought her sister, Rani, was going to take her through the *real* magic portal, but… surprise!  Rani played a hilarious trick!

**Joe:** (Laughing) A hilarious trick indeed!  Instead of a magical portal, Rani sent Mira through… a wheelie bin!  Can you believe it?

**(Sound of a comical "boing" sound effect)**

**Sarah:**  And guess what?  Mira bumped into Raheem, a boy who was also about to go to Unicorn School… but he was *terrified* of the portal!

**Joe:**  Oh boy! This sounds like a real adventure!  Imagine this: you're about to go to a brand-new school, and you have to jump into a mysterious portal.  What would you be feeling?  Excited? Scared?  Maybe a little bit of both?

**(Short pause for listener reflection)**

**Sarah:**  Exactly! It's like when you're going on a rollercoaster – a mix of thrills and chills!  But Raheem's dad, bless his heart, was trying to help him get through the *real* portal!  Not the bin portal, ha ha!

**Joe:**  So, it turns out the "magic portal" wasn't in the bin at all!  It was actually hidden behind some bushes!  It's like a secret entrance to a super-cool school!  That’s a great lesson – sometimes things aren't always what they seem!

**Sarah:**  And just like that, Mira made a new friend, Raheem! Maybe having to go through the bin wasn't so bad after all!  It led to a new friendship!

**Joe:** That's right! Friendships can blossom in the most unexpected places!  Before we go to a quick break, here's a fun riddle for you:  I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?

**(Short pause)**

**Sarah:**  That's a tricky one!  Is it a map?

**Joe:**  Yes!  You got it, Sarah! A map!  Great job!  We'll be back after this short break to find out what happens next at Unicorn School!  Don't go anywhere!

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music fades in and out)**

Joe: Raheem and his dad showed her a gap in the branches where the air looked kind of wobbly and shimmery. Magic, thought Mira. Her tummy gave a little lurch. This was really it! Mira waited for Raheem to say bye to his dad. It took a while because they checked Raheems briefcase twice and then sang a song about the ten Rules of Keeping Safe. But finally Mira and Raheem crawled through the gap in the bushes and into a clearing. Everything looked just a little bit sparkly. Okay, breathed Mira. Ready? Erfg, said Raheem. Mira decided to take that as a yes. She grabbed his arm with one hand and reached out towards the sparkles . . . There was a flash of light that split into the seven colours of the rainbow. Mira felt herself being lifted up and before she knew it they were hurtling through the air. Miras toes tingled and a giggly feeling tickled up her legs, into her tummy and arms and head. Even her hair felt excited. Everything was already so magical, she could hardly stand it. She was on her way to Unicorn School! HOW FUN IS THIS? Mira yelled to Raheem, but he was too busy screaming to reply. Just as quickly as it had appeared, the rainbow light vanished, and for a moment the two of them hung in the air, before dropping with a thump onto a soft haystack. They climbed off the landing haystack, just as the next children were deposited by the rainbow. Mira looked around her and pulled strands of hay out of her hair. In front of them was Unicorn School. It was HUGE. It had turrets and a clocktower and looked a bit like a castle, but lots of it was all on one level, like a bungalow. (Because unicorns dont like stairs, Mira thought. There was nothing about unicorns that she didnt know.) Rani had told Mira that the dormitories, where the pupils slept at night- time, were up in the turrets and that the unicorns slept in their stables. The stables were in a large cobbled yard in front of the school. On the other side of the yard were fields with jumps set up. Those must be where the riding lessons are, Mira thought. She had never been horse- riding, but she had ridden a one-eared donkey at the beach last summer. She thought that unicorn-riding must be easier than that and there would be less chance of falling in the sea. Behind the school, Mira could see the forest and, behind that, enormous ice-capped mountains. Rani said that the Fearsome Forest was where lots of the quests took place. It was huge stretching as far as Mira could see. Miras toes were still tingling. She turned to Raheem and grinned. He still looked a bit vomity from the journey. The rainbow had dropped them off to the side of the Grand Paddock, which seemed to be the school playground for humans and unicorns. Real. Live. Actual. Unicorns! Groups of older kids stood chatting, each with a unicorn next to them, like it was no big deal. Mira realized her mouth was open in astonishment, and quickly closed it. One group were playing football, but they were riding their unicorns, and the unicorns were kicking the ball with their hooves! And over in a far corner of the field some unicorns and their riders were leaping over the jumps. Mira thought they looked a bit like they were flying. Rani had told her that the unicorns developed magical powers as they got older, and that some of them could fly! The excited feeling in Miras chest got bigger and bigger until she felt like she might burst. The unicorns were all amazing different colours with long legs, sleek, glossy manes and glittery horns. It was amazing to think that soon Mira would meet her very own unicorn! Just then Mira heard a burst of laughter to her right. There was Rani and her friends. They were in the third year now Class Yellow. You started in Class Red and then moved up through the colours of the rainbow. And each year you had another stripe added to your school badge. Mira looked at the badge on the sleeve of her T-shirt.

**Sarah:**  Joe, I'm practically bouncing off the walls!  Last time, Mira and Raheem arrived at Unicorn School – and wow, what a place!  Remember those amazing flying unicorns?

**Joe:**  Flying unicorns, sparkly rainbows, and a school that's bigger than a castle! It's enough to make anyone's toes tingle! Speaking of tingling toes, did you know that your toes have more than 7,000 nerve endings? That's a lot of tingly fun!

**(Sound of a whimsical chime)**

**Sarah:**  That's amazing, Joe!  Okay, listeners, let's test your knowledge!  Quick trivia question: What color is the class Mira starts in at Unicorn School? Is it A) Blue, B) Red, C) Green, or D) Yellow?

**(Pause for audience to answer)**

**Joe:**  That's right! It's B) Red!  Just like the first color of the rainbow!  Mira starts her magical journey in Class Red.  Now, imagine this: You're Mira, and you've just stepped onto the Grand Paddock.  What's the first thing you do? Do you:

A) Run straight to the unicorns and give them all giant hugs?
B) Try to ride one of the flying unicorns right away?
C) Look around in awe at everything that's happening?
D) Find Rani and her friends?

**(Pause for audience to think)**

**Sarah:**  All of those sound like fantastic choices!  But in the story, Mira is so amazed by the flying unicorns kicking a ball that she just stands there with her mouth open!  It's so exciting, right?

**Joe:**  It is! It's like stepping into a dream!  And speaking of dreams, did you know that unicorns are often symbols of dreams and wishes coming true?  They represent purity, magic, and wonder!

**Sarah:**  Just like the wonder of learning new things!  Did you know that a group of unicorns is called a blessing?  Isn't that a beautiful name?

**Joe:**  It is!  And speaking of beautiful things, let's hear about what happens next at Unicorn School!  We'll be right back after this short break!

Sarah: What would it look like when she had a full rainbow? Um, said Raheem, taking her out of her daydream. I think we go over there. Turning away from her sister, Mira followed Raheem over to a big banner near the stables that read: WELCOME TO UNICORN SCHOOL, CLASS RED! CHAPTER THREE Unicorn Best Friend Forever! The bell in the clocktower chimed and everyone gathered in their classes. Miras class was the only one with just humans each of the other six class groups were made up of children and unicorns! Seven teachers filed out of the school. Each of them wore a differentcoloured rosette with their name on. A tall, dark-haired teacher stopped in front of Miras class. She was wearing a red rosette which said, Miss Glitterhorn. Good morning, Class Red, said Miss Glitterhorn. Good moooooorning, Miss Glitterhorn! chorused Class Red. Now, before we head into assembly to meet the unicorns, I thought that it would be nice if we all got to know each other! trilled Miss Glitterhorn. Mira sighed. She was SO impatient to meet her new unicorn best friend . . . but she did like the idea of learning her classmates names. After all, they would be her friends too! A girl at the front put her hand up. She had blonde curly hair and was in a wheelchair with rainbow wheels. Yes? Miss Glitterhorn beamed. Do you actually have a horn? No, I dont, said Miss Glitterhorn. She smiled. Now, well all play a getting-to-know-you game where The girl put her hand up again. Yes? said Miss Glitterhorn. Do you have unicorns in your family? No, I dont, said Miss Glitterhorn. She smiled again, although it was a bit smaller this time. So we The girl put her hand up again. So, is it a coincidence that you are called Miss Glitterhorn? YES, said Miss Glitterhorn. Anyway After seventeen questions Miss Glitterhorn decided that actually they would go straight to the assembly and they could get to know each other on the way. Mira and Raheem walked alongside the girl whod been asking all the questions. She told them her name was Darcy and that she was going to be famous one day. Wow, said Raheem. How will you be famous? Darcy shrugged. Ill win a TV talent show probably. My dad says those shows are for people with no talent, said a boy walking next to them. His footsteps were really loud and Mira saw that he was wearing cowboy boots. He had a mop of dirty blond hair and a smug mouth. Mira had heard him saying earlier how his parents were Olympic showjumpers and were making sure he was given the best unicorn. Darcy opened her mouth to reply, but theyd reached the hall and a sternlooking teacher gave her a warning look. Mira gasped when she saw the Great Hall, which was in the centre of the main school building. It was a beautiful indoor paddock and the grass was sprinkled with wildflowers. At one end was a platform, with a glittery mounting block next to it. Around the sides of the hall was a gallery for people to sit in. The other six classes were already there with their unicorns. Miss Glitterhorn pointed Class Red to the front row. Mira felt a flutter of pride. Her sister would be there to see her get her unicorn! A hush descended on the hall, and a tiny woman walked across the paddock and onto the platform. Miss Glitterhorn joined her a moment later, clutching an armful of scrolls and a clipboard. The first woman introduced herself she was Madame Shetland, the head teacher. Madame Shetland cleared her throat and spoke into her microphone. Good morning children and unicorns, and welcome to a new term at Unicorn School. And an extra special welcome to our new students, Class Red, who I trust have been busy learning the School Rules in preparation, said the head teacher. Unicorn School is a place of fun, magic and adventure but it is something to be taken seriously. The bond between child and unicorn is a noble tradition, going back many centuries.

Joe: Alongside your unicorn you will learn and grow to undertake quests and become the protectors of our land, and shine a glittery light throughout the unicorn world. Mira felt a warm glow as she thought how she would definitely take it seriously. And she would definitely follow ALL the rules. As soon as she knew what they were. The head teacher smiled at the gathered pupils. And, of course, even when not at Unicorn School you will take forth the lessons learned here and promote the principles of friendship, kindness, bravery and tolerance. After everyone applauded Madame Shetland, it was FINALLY time for the pairing of Class Red with their unicorns. Mira thought she might explode! Miss Glitterhorn handed the head teacher the clipboard. Jake de Quincy, said Madame Shetland, looking at the clipboard. Mira saw a boy walking up to the platform. It was the one with blonde hair who was wearing cowboy boots. He was carrying his own riding hat with golden wings over the ears. Madame Shetland held the microphone towards Jake. If you could tell us about yourself. Keep it brief. Jake leaned in to the microphone. Im Jake. And Im going to be a champion unicorn showjumper, just like my mum and dad. Miss Glitterhorn handed Jake a scroll, which he held up in front of him. The name of your unicorn will appear on the scroll, declared Madame Shetland. The class gasped as a projection of the scroll appeared on the wall behind him. There was a hushed silence as they waited. The scroll shimmered and then a blurry word appeared. Everyone leaned forward to try and read it as the letters gradually became clear and sharp: Then there was a loud noise from the front of the hall as the double doors swung open, making them all jump. Mira let out an excited squeal and Raheem nearly fell off his chair. Standing proudly in the doorway, was a sparkling, majestic unicorn. He was deep purple with a dark blue mane and a glittering golden horn. He strode towards the mounting block where Jake waited with his arms folded and his eyebrows arched confidently. Mira couldnt contain her excitement and gripped the hands of Raheem and Darcy, until Darcy muttered to her to get off and Raheem looked really uncomfortable. Jake and Pegasus walked away from the platform to the other end of the hall, and Mira felt slightly relieved that they wouldnt have to ride the unicorns in front of everyone. Darcy was the next to be called. She wheeled up a ramp and onto the platform. Madame Shetland held the microphone towards her and Darcy grabbed it. Wow. What can I say? This moment means SO much. I want to thank my mum A speech is not necessary, Darcy! interrupted Madame Shetland. Darcys scroll appeared on the projection. A dramatic whinny came from the double doors and the class turned to look. A unicorn came strutting in her silver coat shimmered and caught the light as she walked. She arrived next to Darcy, swished her mane and struck a pose. Darcy applauded in delight. They made their way over to Jake and Pegasus, and started taking selfies until a teacher confiscated Darcys phone. Next was Seb, who said he loved art. He looked super-excited to meet his unicorn, Firework, who had a rainbow-coloured mane. Then it was Raheems turn. He stayed frozen to his seat when his name was called so Mira gave him an encouraging shove to get him to his feet. Good luck! she whispered. He gulped and made his way to the platform. My name is Raheem and I like books, he said carefully into the microphone. I bet he gets a really clever unicorn, thought Mira. Itll probably be able to read and everything. A loud thundering sound could be heard from outside the hall and the floor seemed to shake. And then a blue shape came galloping into the hall. The unicorn was a blur, racing around the hall before coming to a sudden stop in front of the platform with a stamp of his front hoof. He was midnight blue and the biggest, tallest unicorn theyd seen so far.

**Joe:** Hey there, adventurers! Welcome back to "Adventures in Wonder!"  I'm Joe!

**Sarah:** And I'm Sarah!  And wow, what a magical unicorn pairing ceremony we witnessed last time! Remember Jake and his super cool purple Pegasus?

**Joe:**  And Darcy with her shimmering silver unicorn!  And Seb with his rainbow-maned Firework! It was amazing!

**Sarah:**  But don't forget Raheem and his… *thundering* arrival! That blue unicorn was HUGE! It reminded me of a fluffy blue cloud galloping into the hall!

**Joe:**  A fluffy blue cloud! That's a great description, Sarah!  It made me think of a riddle!  I've got one for our listeners: I’m big and blue, I gallop with a boom, my mane is long, I’m never in a room. What am I?

(Pause for a few seconds)

**Joe:**  …That’s right, it’s Raheem’s giant blue unicorn!

**Sarah:**  Great riddle, Joe! So, what do you think makes a unicorn so special? Is it their magical horn? Their beautiful coats?

**Joe:**  I think it's a mix of everything! Their magical horn, their beautiful coats, but also their personalities!  Some are playful and mischievous, like Jake's Pegasus who probably loves to show jump!

**Sarah:**  And some are calm and gentle, maybe like a unicorn who loves to read books, just like Raheem’s!  Imagine this:  You're riding your own unicorn through a rainbow forest! What color is your unicorn, and what amazing adventures are you having?

(Pause for a few seconds to let kids imagine)

**Joe:** That sounds incredible!  Now, let's talk about something super cool: how unicorns might use their magic!  Maybe they can heal sick animals with a touch of their horn?

**Sarah:**  Or maybe they can make flowers bloom in the middle of winter!  Or even create delicious rainbow ice cream! That would be amazing!

**Joe:**  Speaking of amazing, here's a quick quiz!  True or false: Unicorns can only be found in magical forests?

(Pause for a few seconds)

**Sarah:**  False! Unicorns can be found anywhere imagination takes us!

**Joe:** That’s right!  Just like friendship, kindness, bravery, and tolerance, the values we learned about at Unicorn School! Remember, listeners, you can be brave and kind, just like the unicorns!

**Sarah:** That's right, Joe!  And that’s all the time we have for today’s episode of “Adventures in Wonder!” Join us next time for more magical adventures!

Sarah: Madame Shetland turned to Raheem, only to find he wasnt there, but she soon coaxed him out from behind the mounting block. Brave strutted over to the line of unicorns with Raheem following at a careful distance. More and more children were called up. As each name was read out Mira felt her heart leap into her throat, and then sink back down again. Finally, she looked around and realized she was the only one in Class Red without a unicorn. And finally we have Mira Des began Madame Shetland and then she jumped to see Mira already standing next to her. Im Mira. And I cant wait to meet my unicorn best friend, said Mira into the microphone. She looked over at her sister in the crowd, who gave a deliberate yawn. And I cant wait to win LOADS of medals, said Mira. Madame Shetland looked at her and raised one eyebrow. Miss Glitterhorn handed her the scroll. Miras heart was hammering in her chest. Everyone in the crowd turned towards the double doors. But there was no sign of her unicorn yet. Mira looked back down at her scroll. She could see the word beginning to form. It wasnt long enough to be Princess Delilah Sparklehoof, but the first letter was a D . . . Dancer? Dasher? DESTINY? A surprised sort of gasp echoed around the hall. Mira peered closer at the scroll. It definitely said Dave. Again the heads turned towards the door . . . Again there was no unicorn. Madame Shetland looked over at Miss Glitterhorn, who said, Just a sec, and jogged over to the double doors. She started clicking and waving at something outside. But whatever was being clicked and waved at didnt seem to want to come in. Eventually Madame Shetland went over to help and between them they pushed in the smallest, plumpest unicorn Mira had ever seen. He had his bottom planted firmly on the ground and was making it as difficult as possible for the two teachers to move him. Mira stared. He had a little pot belly and a mane like straw that stuck up at odd angles. Greet your unicorn, dear, said Madame Shetland, giving a slightly forced smile. Miss Glitterhorn was leaning against the mounting block and sweating. Hi . . . Dave, said Mira. The unicorn looked up at her. Okay, so he was a bit small. And he wasnt very glittery. But at least I have a unicorn! she thought. Mira reached out to pat his nose and Dave snorted loudly and put his ears back. She pulled her hand away. A round of applause for our final pair, Mira and Dave! said Madame Shetland. Uncertain claps rippled around the hall. Miras sister was laughing so hard that she had to be taken outside. Mira looked back at her unicorn. There was a twinkle in Daves eye. Mira felt encouraged. She smiled and waved at the crowd. Dave snorted again and lifted his tail. Then he unleashed a giant heap of poo onto Miss Glitterhorns feet. CHAPTER FOUR Daves Doughnuts It took Mira a while to get from assembly to her first lesson, as Dave had sat down again in the corridor and was refusing to move. But Raheem came to help her and together they half-dragged, half-pushed Dave down the hallway on his bottom and towards the classroom. Unicorn School was certainly full of surprises. And challenges. Right now, Dave was being quite a challenge, but Mira was sure they would have a magical time as soon as they got to class. Miss Glitterhorn tutted when they finally arrived. She was standing in front of the whiteboard, cleaning Daves poo off her shoes with a wet wipe. As I was saying, Class Red, School Rule Number 19 is Be On Time, Every Time. Mira gasped. The double desks were like normal desks on one side, but on the other there was a taller, unicorn-sized desk with a bag of hay hanging off it. Underneath each unicorns desk was a basket containing grooming equipment. Raheem scurried over to sit at the desk right at the front where Brave was standing proudly. There was one empty double desk. Dave plodded towards it, behind Mira, and gave a snort. Then he finished off his entire hay bag in two bites.

**Joe:** Hey there, Wonderers! Welcome back to Adventures in Wonder!

**Sarah:**  Hi everyone!  Ready for another amazing adventure?

**Joe:** You bet! Today, we're diving headfirst into the wacky world of Unicorn School with Mira and her… *unique* unicorn, Dave! Remember, last time, Mira finally got her unicorn, but he wasn't exactly what she expected!

**Sarah:**  Exactly! Dave was… well, let's just say he had a personality as big as his… uh… *rear end*!  He was tiny, a little grumpy, and had a surprising talent for… leaving "surprises" wherever he went!

**(Sound of a playful "boing" sound effect)**

**Joe:**  A talent indeed!  Before we get back to Dave's delightful droppings, let's have a quick riddle! What has one horn and loves hay more than anything?

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Sarah:**  That's right, a unicorn!  And speaking of unicorns, remember School Rule Number 19?

**Joe:**  Be On Time, Every Time!  Easier said than done with a unicorn like Dave, I bet!

**Sarah:**  You said it!  Imagine this: you're trying to get to class, but your unicorn is stubbornly refusing to move.  What would you do?  Let's hear your ideas, Wonderers!

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Joe:**  Great ideas, everyone!  Mira and Raheem had to practically *drag* Dave to class!  And guess what?  Each desk had a special unicorn-sized desk attached!

**Sarah:**  And a hay bag!  Dave devoured his in two bites!  Talk about a hungry friend!  That reminds me of another question. What do you think unicorns eat besides hay?  Maybe some magical flowers?  Shiny pebbles?

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Joe:**  Fantastic guesses!  We'll find out more about unicorn diets in future episodes! But back to Mira's day at Unicorn School.  It sounds like a lot of fun… and a lot of cleaning!

**Sarah:**  It certainly was!  Mira's sister was laughing so hard she had to leave the assembly!  And Miss Glitterhorn wasn't too thrilled with Dave's "gift" on her shoes.

**(Sound of a comical "splat" sound effect)**

**Joe:**  Oh boy! That sounds like a story for another day.  But for now, it's time to wrap up our adventure!  What a crazy, wonderful day at Unicorn School.


**Sarah:**  That's right, Joe!  Don't forget to send us your unicorn stories and drawings!  Until next time, keep wondering!

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music swells and then fades out)**

Joe: Theyd made it! Mira gave a happy sigh as she sat down at her desk. Miss Glitterhorn finished running through the School Rules (Mira definitely heard at least some of them) and stood up from behind her desk. Now you have your unicorn, she said, the lessons can begin. We will have two days of lessons, where you will learn all about Unicorn School, and how we look after the land. But, most importantly, you will bond with your unicorns so that on day three, you will be ready to go on your first magical quest. The class oohed and aahed, and there was a buzz of excitement. Mira looked around the room and noticed that Jake and Pegasus were their neighbours. She gave Jake a friendly smile but he was looking at Dave with a disgusted Daves Doughnuts expression on his face. She turned and saw that Dave was gnawing at the corner of the desk. She hoped Miss Glitterhorn wouldnt notice. Right! said Miss Glitterhorn. Lesson one is Getting to Know your Unicorn. You and your unicorn have a very special bond. You were chosen for each other by the purest kind of magic: friendship. But youve only just met and you must earn your unicorns trust. First, grooming. This is very relaxing for unicorns. Pick up your brushes and off you go! Mira picked up a soft brush. Shed read all about grooming. She reached out to put the brush on Daves back and he ducked, avoiding her hand, and side-stepped out of the way. Mira stepped closer to him and tried again but he just did the same thing. Then she tried a different brush but he sidestepped again. They kept doing this and shuffling further and further away from their desk until a girl called Tamsin put her hand up to say that they were making her unicorn feel uncomfortable. Mira dragged Dave back to their desk. She tried hiding the brush behind her back, she tried attaching it to a stick. She even tried brushing herself to show him how nice it was, until Miss Glitterhorn came over to ask what she was doing. Then, hoping to put him in a better mood, Mira gave Dave the unicorn crown Daves Doughnuts shed made for him. Dave looked at the crown thoughtfully for a moment and then he ate it. Mira suddenly had a brilliant idea. Dave must be hungry! Thats why he wasnt paying attention! Mira remembered Miss Glitterhorn saying Treating is Cheating (Unicorn School Rule 54) and You Must Not Bribe Your Unicorn (Unicorn School Rule 3), but this was tending to Daves needs. She was looking after him! She reached into her bag for the treats shed bought with Mum earlier. But the shopping bag was full of doughnuts, not carrots! Mira realized she must have picked up her mums bag by mistake . . . now Dave didnt have ANY treats. (And mum had taken a bag of carrots to work with her.) Mira could feel her eyes welling up with tears as she dropped the doughnuts on the floor. NOTHING was going right today. But something extraordinary was happening to Dave. His nostrils flared and his mouth twitched. With a happy little whinny he gobbled up a doughnut, then another and, before Mira could stop him, he had eaten them all AND the bag. Suddenly, Dave was like a different unicorn. His eyes shone and his mane even looked swishy. He let Mira stroke his soft muzzle and then he stamped a hoof in joy. Mira grabbed a brush and started combing it through his mane. She looked around the room, fizzing with pride. She hoped everyone would see how happy Dave suddenly was he was showing his teeth in a sort of weird grin. He must really like doughnuts, she thought. Maybe she would win a medal for Best at Cheering Up Unicorns! Then it all went wrong. Dave reared up on his hind legs and let out a loud and gleeful neigh. He shot forwards, knocking over a chair. A few children and unicorns turned towards them, startled, and Miss Glitterhorn looked up from her desk.

 **(Sound of playful, whimsical music fades in and then fades slightly to background level)**

**Joe:** Hey everyone, and welcome back to "Wonder World with Joe and Sarah!"

**Sarah:** Hi kids! Are you ready for another amazing adventure?  Today, we're diving into the magical world of unicorns!

**Joe:**  Unicorns!  They're majestic, sparkly, and… surprisingly messy eaters, according to our story!

**Sarah:** (Laughing) That's right, Joe! We left off with Mira and her unicorn, Dave, having a bit of a… *doughnut* dilemma! Remember, kids, never bribe your unicorn, even if it's with delicious treats!  But it seems Dave had a very specific craving!

**Joe:**  It was a real rollercoaster!  Mira thought Dave was sad, but then he gobbled up all the doughnuts and became super happy! It's like he needed a sugar rush to power his unicorn magic!

**Sarah:**  Exactly! It reminds me of how *we* need healthy food to have energy for playing and learning.  But instead of doughnuts, we should fuel up with fruits and veggies, right?

**(Sound of a short, playful jingle)**

**Joe:** That's a great point, Sarah! Now, let's test your unicorn knowledge!  Quick trivia question: What's a unicorn's favourite food? Is it A) sparkly rainbows, B)  golden apples, or C)  delicious doughnuts?

**Sarah:**  Hmm, tricky one!  I think we learned the answer from Mira's story…

**(Pause for audience participation)**

**Joe:**  The answer is…  it depends on the unicorn!  Some might love rainbows, others golden apples, but Dave clearly preferred doughnuts… at least for a while!

**Sarah:**  See?  Even unicorns have different tastes! Now, imagine this: You're at Unicorn School, and your unicorn is feeling grumpy. What would you do to cheer them up?  Would you sing them a song?  Give them a hug?  Tell them a joke?

**(Pause for audience participation)**

**Joe:** Great ideas, kids! Remember, kindness and understanding are the best magic!

**Sarah:**  Speaking of magic, let's talk about the power of friendship! Mira and Dave's story shows us how important it is to build trust and connection. Just like Mira learned to understand Dave's needs, we need to learn to understand our friends and family.

**Joe:** That's so true! And remember, kids, be curious and explore the world around you, just like Mira did at Unicorn School!

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music swells and then fades out)**

**Sarah:** That's all the time we have for today's adventure! Don't forget to send us your unicorn stories and drawings!  Until next time, keep wondering!

**Joe:** Bye everyone!

** Bye everyone!

Sarah: Then, full of sugary, doughnutty joy, Dave galloped around the classroom, scattering the pupils and their unicorns and destroying the matchstick fairytale castle that Grace Hobbs had brought in as a present for her unicorn and had taken literally weeks to make. Finally, he skidded into Jakes desk and crushed his pencil case. Jake looked furious. After Miss Glitterhorn had wrangled Dave into Daves Doughnuts the Naughty Stall, she announced that since most pupils had successfully groomed their unicorns, the class would now be creating pieces of art together. She suggested that Mira use the time to read the rule book, paying special attention to Unicorn School Rule 79: No Havoc Indoors. Thats one Havoc Point already, Im afraid. Three Havoc Points will result in detention, she said. Then, that pupil and their unicorn will not be able to attend the first quest. Mira felt a panicky feeling in her stomach. She couldnt miss out on the first quest! She snuck a look at Dave over her shoulder and saw that he was happily snoozing in the Naughty Stall. He looked very sweet. But she couldnt quite ignore the thought she kept pushing to the back of her mind. What if they didnt have a totally magical bond? What if Dave wasnt going to be her unicorn best friend? CHAPTER FIVE History Comes Alive . . . After a good nights sleep in Red Dormitory, Mira woke up feeling full of hope for the day ahead. She picked Dave up from his stable and gave him a little pep talk on the way to class. At least he was walking alongside her today. Mira felt that was progress. I know it feels different, being in school now, like a big unicorn. But well get through it together! I know we can be best friends! Dave gave Mira a sideways glance and then did a long, rumbling fart. The first lesson of the day was History of the Unicorn and their teacher, Mr Trotsky, was giving a lecture on famous unicorns of the last thousand years. Mira lost concentration a couple of times, first when another class rode their unicorns past the window and then when Darcy passed round a note saying Would you rather have a unicorn that could breathe fire or one that had electric hooves? And Mr Trotsky did have a slow, droney voice. I hope youve been taking notes, class, Mr Trotsky said, after talking for a very long time. We have another five hundred years of unicorns to get through after our break and then you will each prepare a presentation about a famous unicorn from history, to be performed at the end of the day. Lets make history come alive! After break time Dave trotted over to the grooming basket under their desk. With his front hoof, he knocked everything out of the basket, lay down in it and went to sleep. Mira looked around at the other unicorns who were sitting up nicely at their desks. Some were even helping to take notes. Sebs unicorn, Firework, seemed to be sketching with his horn. Im sure Dave can do that too . . . when hes awake, thought Mira. She smiled and picked out different coloured pens to underline her notes. That cheered her up even more. Top Five Best Unicorns from History Unicornardo da Vinci painter and inventor King Henry the Neighth very fat unicorn who had six wives Winst-horn Churchill unicorn prime minister during the war Queen Boudiccorn the most magnificent Celtic warrior queen unicorn King Arth-horn and the Unicorns of the Round Stable.

Speaker Joe should End the podcast by saying this: Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!

 **(Sound of playful music intro)**

**Joe:** Hey there, super cool kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids! I’m Joe!

**Sarah:** And I’m Sarah!  Ready for another amazing adventure?

**Joe:** You bet! Today, we're diving into the magical world of unicorns, just like Mira from our story! Remember, she's trying to make friends with her unicorn, Dave, who's… well, let's just say he's a bit of a goofball!

**Sarah:**  He sure is!  And we learned about some super cool historical unicorns!  Did you know there was a unicorn Prime Minister?!

**Joe:**  Winst-horn Churchill!  That's a name to remember!  It's like history, but with a sparkly horn!

**Sarah:** Exactly! Now, let's imagine this:  If YOU could have a historical unicorn as a pet, which one would you choose and why?  Think about it!  Would you want a creative Unicornardo da Vinci, helping you paint masterpieces? Or maybe a brave warrior queen unicorn like Queen Boudiccorn, going on daring adventures with you?

**(Sound of a short musical interlude)**

**Joe:**  Speaking of adventures, let's play a quick game! I'll give you a riddle, and you try to guess the answer!  Ready?

**Sarah:** Ready!

**Joe:** I have a long neck, a very long neck, and I live in Africa. What am I?

**(Pause for kids to guess)**

**Sarah:**  A giraffe!

**Joe:**  That's right!  Giraffes are amazing animals! Did you know their spots help them camouflage in the tall grass? Just like unicorns might blend in with clouds!

**Sarah:**  That's a great comparison, Joe!  It shows how different animals have special features to help them survive, just like how Dave, despite being a bit clumsy, might have his own unique charm!

**Joe:** Exactly!  Let's talk about nature for a bit.  Imagine a rainforest! It's full of amazing plants and animals!  What are some of your favorite rainforest animals?  Maybe monkeys swinging through the trees, or colourful parrots squawking greetings?

**(Sound of jungle sounds)**

**Sarah:**  And don't forget the sloths! They're so slow and sleepy, kind of like Dave when he's taking a nap in the grooming basket!

**Joe:**  Haha, perfect comparison! Now, quick trivia question:  What's the biggest animal in the rainforest?

**(Pause for kids to guess)**

**Sarah:**  Is it the jaguar?

**Joe:**  Not quite! It's actually the Amazon River dolphin!  They're pink!  Isn't that amazing?

**Sarah:** Wow!  Learning about animals is so much fun!  It reminds me of how much fun it is to learn about unicorns too!

**(Sound of playful music)**

**Joe:**  That's right!  And that’s all the time we have for today's episode! Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, Joe! That’s an amazing start to Mira’s adventure!  Unicorn School sounds incredibly magical!  I bet *I* would love to go to Unicorn School!  So, Joe, what kind of treats do you think unicorns would like?  Do they like sparkly donuts like the ones Mira's mum is buying? Or maybe rainbow-colored carrots?
[INFO] Joe: Great question, Sarah!  It's a bit of a mystery, isn't it?  The story doesn't tell us exactly how it works, which makes it even more exciting!  Maybe it's a swirling vortex of rainbow colours? Or perhaps it's hidden behind a waterfall, only visible to those who believe in magic!  Imagine this, kids: you're standing in front of the portal. What does it look like?  Use your imaginations and draw a picture of the Magic Portal!
[INFO] Joe: That's a super question, Sarah!  I think sparkly donuts would be a HUGE hit! Unicorns are magical, so they probably love sparkly things! But maybe they also have a taste for things from nature, like magical rainbow carrots that grant wishes, or maybe shimmering apples that make you fly!  What do *you* think they'd like, kids listening at home?  Maybe send us an email or leave a comment telling us your unicorn treat ideas!
[INFO] Sarah: Ooh, I like the idea of wishing carrots!  And flying apples sound amazing!  Speaking of amazing, Joe, how does this Magic Portal work? Is it like a wardrobe that leads to Narnia?  Or maybe a sparkly door that plays twinkle-twinkle little star when you open it?
[INFO] Sarah: I think mine would be a shimmering pool of water, with little sparkles dancing on the surface.  And when you step in, it feels like you’re floating on a cloud!  Okay, Joe, before Mira gets to Unicorn School, let’s have a quick quiz for our listeners!
[INFO] Joe: I love quizzes!  Okay, here’s one:  What did Mira try to attach to Pickles the cat?  Was it A) a sparkly hat, B) a unicorn horn, or C) a pair of rainbow wings?
[INFO] Sarah: That’s a tricky one!  Kids, shout out your answer!  I think I know the answer…
[INFO] Joe: You’re right, Sarah! The answer is B, a unicorn horn!  Poor Pickles!  Let’s see what other magical adventures await Mira at Unicorn School!  Coming up next, we'll find out what happens when Mira and Rani get to the supermarket and choose their unicorn treats!  Stay tuned, kids!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super listeners! Welcome back to "Adventures with Joe and Sarah"!  Last time, we left Mira just about to enter Unicorn School!  But wait… something unexpected happened!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Something *totally* unexpected, Joe!  Mira thought her sister, Rani, was going to take her through the *real* magic portal, but… surprise!  Rani played a hilarious trick!
[INFO] Joe: ** (Laughing) A hilarious trick indeed!  Instead of a magical portal, Rani sent Mira through… a wheelie bin!  Can you believe it?
[INFO] Sarah: **  And guess what?  Mira bumped into Raheem, a boy who was also about to go to Unicorn School… but he was *terrified* of the portal!
[INFO] Joe: **  Oh boy! This sounds like a real adventure!  Imagine this: you're about to go to a brand-new school, and you have to jump into a mysterious portal.  What would you be feeling?  Excited? Scared?  Maybe a little bit of both?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly! It's like when you're going on a rollercoaster – a mix of thrills and chills!  But Raheem's dad, bless his heart, was trying to help him get through the *real* portal!  Not the bin portal, ha ha!
[INFO] Joe: **  So, it turns out the "magic portal" wasn't in the bin at all!  It was actually hidden behind some bushes!  It's like a secret entrance to a super-cool school!  That’s a great lesson – sometimes things aren't always what they seem!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And just like that, Mira made a new friend, Raheem! Maybe having to go through the bin wasn't so bad after all!  It led to a new friendship!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's right! Friendships can blossom in the most unexpected places!  Before we go to a quick break, here's a fun riddle for you:  I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's a tricky one!  Is it a map?
[INFO] Joe: **  Yes!  You got it, Sarah! A map!  Great job!  We'll be back after this short break to find out what happens next at Unicorn School!  Don't go anywhere!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super sleuths! Welcome back to Unicorn School Adventures!  Sarah, are you ready for more magical mayhem?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Joe, I'm practically bouncing off the walls!  Last time, Mira and Raheem arrived at Unicorn School – and wow, what a place!  Remember those amazing flying unicorns?
[INFO] Joe: **  Flying unicorns, sparkly rainbows, and a school that's bigger than a castle! It's enough to make anyone's toes tingle! Speaking of tingling toes, did you know that your toes have more than 7,000 nerve endings? That's a lot of tingly fun!
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's amazing, Joe!  Okay, listeners, let's test your knowledge!  Quick trivia question: What color is the class Mira starts in at Unicorn School? Is it A) Blue, B) Red, C) Green, or D) Yellow?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's right! It's B) Red!  Just like the first color of the rainbow!  Mira starts her magical journey in Class Red.  Now, imagine this: You're Mira, and you've just stepped onto the Grand Paddock.  What's the first thing you do? Do you:
[INFO] Sarah: **  All of those sound like fantastic choices!  But in the story, Mira is so amazed by the flying unicorns kicking a ball that she just stands there with her mouth open!  It's so exciting, right?
[INFO] Joe: **  It is! It's like stepping into a dream!  And speaking of dreams, did you know that unicorns are often symbols of dreams and wishes coming true?  They represent purity, magic, and wonder!
[INFO] Joe: **  It is!  And speaking of beautiful things, let's hear about what happens next at Unicorn School!  We'll be right back after this short break!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Just like the wonder of learning new things!  Did you know that a group of unicorns is called a blessing?  Isn't that a beautiful name?
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super sleuths and unicorn enthusiasts! Welcome back to "Adventures in Wonder!" I'm Joe!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And I'm Sarah!  And boy, oh boy, did we leave off at a super exciting part of Mira's story at Unicorn School! Remember, Mira and her class are about to meet their very own unicorns!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's right!  It’s like choosing your very own magical best friend! But first, a quick question for our listeners! What do you think makes a good best friend? Is it someone who shares your snacks?  Someone who always makes you laugh? Let us know in the comments!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, back to Mira! Remember, she's in Class Red, and they're all super excited to meet their unicorns.  Imagine the scene:  a huge hall, like a giant indoor playground, with wildflowers sprinkled on the grass!  It’s practically a unicorn paradise!
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly! And there’s even a glittery mounting block! How cool is that?! It's like a super fancy step for the unicorns to get on!  Speaking of fancy, did you know that a group of unicorns is called a "blessing"? How magical is that?!
[INFO] Sarah: **  A blessing! I love it!  So, Madame Shetland, the head teacher, is about to introduce the unicorns.  She’s talking about the special bond between kids and unicorns – it’s like a super strong friendship that lasts forever! It’s a tradition that goes way back!  Can you imagine having a unicorn friend for centuries?
[INFO] Joe: ** That’s like having a super-powered, sparkly best friend for a REALLY long time!  Okay, listeners, imagine this: You're about to meet YOUR unicorn. What color would its coat be? Would it have a rainbow mane? What would its name be?  Tell us!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And then, the moment arrives!  Each child gets to meet their unicorn!  It’s like opening the best present ever!  Mira’s heart is probably fluttering like a butterfly’s wings!
[INFO] Joe: **  I bet!  It’s a magical moment, filled with wonder and excitement!  What do you think Mira’s unicorn will look like? Will it be playful and mischievous, or calm and gentle?  Let's find out next time on "Adventures in Wonder!"
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, adventurers! Welcome back to "Adventures in Wonder!"  I'm Joe!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And I'm Sarah!  And wow, what a magical unicorn pairing ceremony we witnessed last time! Remember Jake and his super cool purple Pegasus?
[INFO] Joe: **  And Darcy with her shimmering silver unicorn!  And Seb with his rainbow-maned Firework! It was amazing!
[INFO] Joe: **  A fluffy blue cloud! That's a great description, Sarah!  It made me think of a riddle!  I've got one for our listeners: I’m big and blue, I gallop with a boom, my mane is long, I’m never in a room. What am I?
[INFO] Sarah: **  But don't forget Raheem and his… *thundering* arrival! That blue unicorn was HUGE! It reminded me of a fluffy blue cloud galloping into the hall!
[INFO] Joe: **  …That’s right, it’s Raheem’s giant blue unicorn!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Great riddle, Joe! So, what do you think makes a unicorn so special? Is it their magical horn? Their beautiful coats?
[INFO] Joe: **  I think it's a mix of everything! Their magical horn, their beautiful coats, but also their personalities!  Some are playful and mischievous, like Jake's Pegasus who probably loves to show jump!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And some are calm and gentle, maybe like a unicorn who loves to read books, just like Raheem’s!  Imagine this:  You're riding your own unicorn through a rainbow forest! What color is your unicorn, and what amazing adventures are you having?
[INFO] Joe: ** That sounds incredible!  Now, let's talk about something super cool: how unicorns might use their magic!  Maybe they can heal sick animals with a touch of their horn?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Or maybe they can make flowers bloom in the middle of winter!  Or even create delicious rainbow ice cream! That would be amazing!
[INFO] Joe: **  Speaking of amazing, here's a quick quiz!  True or false: Unicorns can only be found in magical forests?
[INFO] Sarah: **  False! Unicorns can be found anywhere imagination takes us!
[INFO] Joe: ** That’s right!  Just like friendship, kindness, bravery, and tolerance, the values we learned about at Unicorn School! Remember, listeners, you can be brave and kind, just like the unicorns!
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's right, Joe!  And that’s all the time we have for today’s episode of “Adventures in Wonder!” Join us next time for more magical adventures!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, Wonderers! Welcome back to Adventures in Wonder!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hi everyone!  Ready for another amazing adventure?
[INFO] Joe: ** You bet! Today, we're diving headfirst into the wacky world of Unicorn School with Mira and her… *unique* unicorn, Dave! Remember, last time, Mira finally got her unicorn, but he wasn't exactly what she expected!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly! Dave was… well, let's just say he had a personality as big as his… uh… *rear end*!  He was tiny, a little grumpy, and had a surprising talent for… leaving "surprises" wherever he went!
[INFO] Joe: **  A talent indeed!  Before we get back to Dave's delightful droppings, let's have a quick riddle! What has one horn and loves hay more than anything?
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's right, a unicorn!  And speaking of unicorns, remember School Rule Number 19?
[INFO] Joe: **  Be On Time, Every Time!  Easier said than done with a unicorn like Dave, I bet!
[INFO] Sarah: **  You said it!  Imagine this: you're trying to get to class, but your unicorn is stubbornly refusing to move.  What would you do?  Let's hear your ideas, Wonderers!
[INFO] Joe: **  Great ideas, everyone!  Mira and Raheem had to practically *drag* Dave to class!  And guess what?  Each desk had a special unicorn-sized desk attached!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And a hay bag!  Dave devoured his in two bites!  Talk about a hungry friend!  That reminds me of another question. What do you think unicorns eat besides hay?  Maybe some magical flowers?  Shiny pebbles?
[INFO] Joe: **  Fantastic guesses!  We'll find out more about unicorn diets in future episodes! But back to Mira's day at Unicorn School.  It sounds like a lot of fun… and a lot of cleaning!
[INFO] Sarah: **  It certainly was!  Mira's sister was laughing so hard she had to leave the assembly!  And Miss Glitterhorn wasn't too thrilled with Dave's "gift" on her shoes.
[INFO] Joe: **  Oh boy! That sounds like a story for another day.  But for now, it's time to wrap up our adventure!  What a crazy, wonderful day at Unicorn School.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's right, Joe!  Don't forget to send us your unicorn stories and drawings!  Until next time, keep wondering!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey everyone, and welcome back to "Wonder World with Joe and Sarah!"
[INFO] Sarah: ** Hi kids! Are you ready for another amazing adventure?  Today, we're diving into the magical world of unicorns!
[INFO] Joe: **  Unicorns!  They're majestic, sparkly, and… surprisingly messy eaters, according to our story!
[INFO] Sarah: ** (Laughing) That's right, Joe! We left off with Mira and her unicorn, Dave, having a bit of a… *doughnut* dilemma! Remember, kids, never bribe your unicorn, even if it's with delicious treats!  But it seems Dave had a very specific craving!
[INFO] Joe: **  It was a real rollercoaster!  Mira thought Dave was sad, but then he gobbled up all the doughnuts and became super happy! It's like he needed a sugar rush to power his unicorn magic!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly! It reminds me of how *we* need healthy food to have energy for playing and learning.  But instead of doughnuts, we should fuel up with fruits and veggies, right?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a great point, Sarah! Now, let's test your unicorn knowledge!  Quick trivia question: What's a unicorn's favourite food? Is it A) sparkly rainbows, B)  golden apples, or C)  delicious doughnuts?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hmm, tricky one!  I think we learned the answer from Mira's story…
[INFO] Joe: **  The answer is…  it depends on the unicorn!  Some might love rainbows, others golden apples, but Dave clearly preferred doughnuts… at least for a while!
[INFO] Sarah: **  See?  Even unicorns have different tastes! Now, imagine this: You're at Unicorn School, and your unicorn is feeling grumpy. What would you do to cheer them up?  Would you sing them a song?  Give them a hug?  Tell them a joke?
[INFO] Joe: ** Great ideas, kids! Remember, kindness and understanding are the best magic!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Speaking of magic, let's talk about the power of friendship! Mira and Dave's story shows us how important it is to build trust and connection. Just like Mira learned to understand Dave's needs, we need to learn to understand our friends and family.
[INFO] Joe: ** That's so true! And remember, kids, be curious and explore the world around you, just like Mira did at Unicorn School!
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's all the time we have for today's adventure! Don't forget to send us your unicorn stories and drawings!  Until next time, keep wondering!
[INFO] Joe: ** Bye everyone!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super cool kids! Welcome back to Podify Kids! I’m Joe!
[INFO] Sarah: ** And I’m Sarah!  Ready for another amazing adventure?
[INFO] Joe: ** You bet! Today, we're diving into the magical world of unicorns, just like Mira from our story! Remember, she's trying to make friends with her unicorn, Dave, who's… well, let's just say he's a bit of a goofball!
[INFO] Sarah: **  He sure is!  And we learned about some super cool historical unicorns!  Did you know there was a unicorn Prime Minister?!
[INFO] Joe: **  Winst-horn Churchill!  That's a name to remember!  It's like history, but with a sparkly horn!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Exactly! Now, let's imagine this:  If YOU could have a historical unicorn as a pet, which one would you choose and why?  Think about it!  Would you want a creative Unicornardo da Vinci, helping you paint masterpieces? Or maybe a brave warrior queen unicorn like Queen Boudiccorn, going on daring adventures with you?
[INFO] Joe: **  Speaking of adventures, let's play a quick game! I'll give you a riddle, and you try to guess the answer!  Ready?
[INFO] Sarah: ** Ready!
[INFO] Joe: ** I have a long neck, a very long neck, and I live in Africa. What am I?
[INFO] Sarah: **  A giraffe!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's right!  Giraffes are amazing animals! Did you know their spots help them camouflage in the tall grass? Just like unicorns might blend in with clouds!
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's a great comparison, Joe!  It shows how different animals have special features to help them survive, just like how Dave, despite being a bit clumsy, might have his own unique charm!
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly!  Let's talk about nature for a bit.  Imagine a rainforest! It's full of amazing plants and animals!  What are some of your favorite rainforest animals?  Maybe monkeys swinging through the trees, or colourful parrots squawking greetings?
[INFO] Sarah: **  And don't forget the sloths! They're so slow and sleepy, kind of like Dave when he's taking a nap in the grooming basket!
[INFO] Joe: **  Haha, perfect comparison! Now, quick trivia question:  What's the biggest animal in the rainforest?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Is it the jaguar?
[INFO] Joe: **  Not quite! It's actually the Amazon River dolphin!  They're pink!  Isn't that amazing?
[INFO] Sarah: ** Wow!  Learning about animals is so much fun!  It reminds me of how much fun it is to learn about unicorns too!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's right!  And that’s all the time we have for today's episode! Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!
