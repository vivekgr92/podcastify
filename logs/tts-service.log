[2024-12-09T21:14:05.195Z] [INFO] Content: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry.  Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight.  And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry.

[2024-12-09T21:14:05.195Z] [INFO] Content: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge.  The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.  YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate).  In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2.  Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers.  It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS.  It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work.  Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023.  They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market.  The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins.  Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says.  He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names).  I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.  But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says.  The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform.  Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge.  Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs).  OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen.  Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods.  To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs.  Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland.  People are testing things that you would never think you could test.  Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find.  In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles.  After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down.  To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says.  After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs.  Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one.  RRIDs solve this.  In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts.  In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are.  Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers.  We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski.  Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says.
[2024-12-09T21:14:05.195Z] [INFO] Content: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step.  In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use.  In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies.  Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations.  In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site.  The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says.  Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS.  Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says.  Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies.  In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation.  But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.  When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time.  That was a shock, Virk says.  At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point.  Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies.  In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.  They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research.  Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.  Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality.  It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences.  The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices.  Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.  Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance.  In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made.  The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody.  Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods.  A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[2024-12-09T21:14:05.196Z] [INFO] Content: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it.  It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.  When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein.

But not one published study had used these antibodies.  About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing.  And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1.  Laflammes experience isnt unusual.  Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets.  The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.  Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research.  He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein.  There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules.  Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK.  Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful.  Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction.  This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments.  Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein.  To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked.  For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves.  They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules.  To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.  When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue.  Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world.  In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised.  Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies.  What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies.  When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating.

[2024-12-09T21:14:10.446Z] [INFO] **Sarah:** Wow, Joe, that's a fascinating story about the C9ORF72 protein and the challenges with antibodies. It seems like a real problem in scientific research.

**Joe:** It definitely is, Sarah. And it's not just antibodies. There are many other reagents, like enzymes and kits, that can be unreliable and lead to misleading results.

**Sarah:** So, what can be done about it?

**Joe:** Well, there are a few initiatives underway to address this issue. One is the Antibody Validation Initiative, which aims to develop standards for antibody testing and validation. Another is the Reproducibility Initiative, which is working to improve the overall reproducibility of scientific research.

**Sarah:** I think those initiatives are really important. I mean, how can we trust research findings if we're not sure the reagents are working properly?

**Joe:** Exactly. It's crucial to have reliable tools and reagents to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of research. Otherwise, we're just wasting time and resources, and potentially hindering scientific progress.

**Sarah:** It's also frustrating for researchers, right? Imagine spending months or even years on a project, only to find out that your results are unreliable because of a faulty reagent.

**Joe:** Absolutely. It can be incredibly disheartening and demotivating. That's why it's so important to address this issue and ensure that researchers have access to high-quality reagents they can trust.

**Sarah:** Do you think these initiatives will make a difference?

**Joe:** I'm optimistic that they will. There's a growing awareness of the problem, and more and more researchers are demanding better quality reagents. I believe that with concerted efforts, we can make significant progress in improving the reliability of scientific research.

[2024-12-09T21:14:18.179Z] [INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Antibody Validation with Joe and Sarah

**Sarah:** Hey Joe, thanks for joining me today to talk about antibody validation. It's a topic that often gets overlooked but is crucial for reliable research.

**Joe:** Absolutely, Sarah. I'm excited to dive in. As you know, antibodies are like the workhorses of biological research. They're used in countless experiments, from basic cell biology to complex disease models. But the problem is, not all antibodies are created equal.

**Sarah:** Exactly. There's a lot of variability in quality and specificity. That's where initiatives like YCharOS come in, right?

**Joe:** Right. YCharOS is a fantastic resource for researchers. They rigorously test commercially available antibodies and provide detailed characterization reports. This helps researchers choose the best antibodies for their experiments and avoid wasting time and resources on unreliable ones.

**Sarah:** That's so important. I remember reading a study where they found that two-thirds of the antibodies tested didn't work as advertised. That's a huge problem!

**Joe:** It definitely is. It highlights the need for initiatives like YCharOS. They're helping to improve the overall quality of research by ensuring that researchers have access to reliable tools.

**Sarah:** And it's not just about saving time and money. Using the wrong antibody can lead to misleading results and even incorrect conclusions. That can have serious implications for scientific progress and even patient care.

**Joe:** Absolutely. That's why it's so crucial to choose the right antibodies and validate them properly. YCharOS provides a valuable service by taking on this task and making the data publicly available.

**Sarah:** Now, YCharOS focuses on testing antibodies for specificity. But what about other aspects of validation, like sensitivity and reproducibility?

**Joe:** That's a great point. Specificity is definitely important, but it's not the only factor. Researchers also need to consider the sensitivity and reproducibility of the antibody. These factors can vary depending on the experimental conditions and the specific antibody being used.

**Sarah:** So, what advice would you give to researchers who are choosing and validating antibodies?

**Joe:** First, do your research. Look for antibodies that have been validated by initiatives like YCharOS or other reputable sources. Second, consider the specific needs of your experiment. What level of sensitivity and reproducibility do you need? Third, don't be afraid to reach out to the antibody manufacturer or other experts for advice.

**Sarah:** That's great advice, Joe. Thanks for sharing your insights. I think this conversation will be really helpful for researchers who are looking to improve the quality and reliability of their work.

**Joe:** Absolutely, Sarah. I believe that initiatives like YCharOS, combined with careful experimental design and validation, can have a major impact on the future of scientific research. By ensuring that we're using the best possible tools, we can accelerate scientific progress and ultimately improve human health.

Joe: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step.  In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use.  In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies.  Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations.  In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site.  The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says.  Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS.  Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says.  Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies.  In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation.  But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.  When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time.  That was a shock, Virk says.  At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point.  Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies.  In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.  They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research.  Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.  Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality.  It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences.  The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices.  Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.  Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance.  In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made.  The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody.  Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods.  A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[2024-12-09T21:14:25.737Z] [INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: The Antibody Revolution

**Joe:** Hey Sarah, welcome back to the podcast! Today, we're diving deep into the world of antibodies and the efforts to improve their reliability and reproducibility in research.

**Sarah:** This is a topic close to my heart, Joe. As a researcher myself, I've seen firsthand the frustration and wasted time that can come from using unreliable antibodies. So, tell me, what are the biggest challenges in this field right now?

**Joe:** Well, the biggest challenge is definitely the sheer number and variety of antibodies available. There are millions of them out there, each targeting different proteins, species, and applications. This makes it incredibly difficult for researchers to choose the right antibody for their experiment and to know whether it will actually work as expected.

**Sarah:** Right, and even if you find an antibody that seems promising, there's no guarantee it's been properly validated. Validation is crucial, but unfortunately, less than 5% of antibodies have been validated through methods like knockout studies.

**Joe:** Exactly. That's why initiatives like CiteAb and YCharOS are so important. They're building databases and platforms that collect information about antibody performance and validation, making it easier for researchers to find reliable antibodies.

**Sarah:** I also find the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community fascinating. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers to tackle this issue collaboratively. Their efforts to promote best practices and reward researchers for using validated antibodies are crucial steps towards improving reproducibility.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And it's not just about individual researchers; manufacturers are also playing a key role. Some are shifting towards producing recombinant antibodies, which offer greater consistency and standardization compared to traditional methods.

**Sarah:** That's fantastic news! So, where do you see the field of antibody research going in the future?

**Joe:** I'm optimistic that we'll see a significant improvement in antibody reliability and reproducibility in the coming years. The combined efforts of researchers, manufacturers, and initiatives like OGA, CiteAb, and YCharOS are paving the way for a future where antibody-based research is more reliable and efficient than ever before.

**Sarah:** I couldn't agree more, Joe. This progress will not only save researchers time and resources but also lead to more robust and trustworthy scientific findings, ultimately benefiting science and society as a whole. 

**Joe:** Well said, Sarah. This has been a fascinating conversation, and I'm excited to see how the antibody revolution unfolds.

**Sarah:** Thanks for having me on, Joe. It's been a pleasure.

Sarah: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

[2024-12-09T21:14:34.992Z] [INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a fascinating article, Joe. I had no idea that the reliability of antibodies was such a big issue in scientific research. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

Joe: Sure, Sarah. The article talks about how the use of antibodies in research has changed over the past decade, with a significant increase in the use of recombinant antibodies. Recombinant antibodies are essentially artificial antibodies that are produced in the lab, as opposed to traditional antibodies that are derived from animals.

Sarah: So, what's the problem with using traditional antibodies?

Joe: Well, the main problem is that traditional antibodies can be very variable in their quality. This means that they may not always work the way they're supposed to, which can lead to inaccurate results. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are much more consistent in their quality, so they're generally considered to be more reliable.

Sarah: That makes sense. So, are scientists just switching to using recombinant antibodies all the time now?

Joe: Not necessarily. Recombinant antibodies can be more expensive than traditional antibodies, so it's not always feasible to use them. Additionally, some scientists may be hesitant to switch to a new type of antibody if they're already familiar with using traditional antibodies.

Sarah: I can see that. But if recombinant antibodies are more reliable, wouldn't it be worth it to switch?

Joe: It depends on the specific situation. If a scientist is doing research that requires a high degree of accuracy, then using recombinant antibodies would be the best option. However, if the research is less critical, then using traditional antibodies may be sufficient.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. But what about the ethical concerns mentioned in the article? Some scientists seem reluctant to admit that the antibodies they've been using are unreliable.

Joe: That's a valid concern. It's important for scientists to be honest about the limitations of their research, and that includes admitting when they've used an antibody that may not be reliable. However, it's also important to remember that science is a process of trial and error, and sometimes even the best scientists make mistakes.

Sarah: Right, I understand. So, what do you think the future holds for antibody use in research?

Joe: I think the future is bright. The development of new technologies, such as recombinant antibodies and improved validation methods, is making it easier than ever to ensure that antibodies are reliable. Additionally, there's a growing awareness of the importance of antibody validation in the scientific community.

Sarah: That's great to hear. It's important that scientists have access to reliable tools so they can conduct accurate research.

Joe: Absolutely. And who knows, maybe someday we'll have a world where all antibodies are created equal.

Sarah: (Laughs) Now that would be a dream come true. Thanks for the informative discussion, Joe. I feel like I have a much better understanding of the issues surrounding antibody use in research now.

Joe: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could help.
