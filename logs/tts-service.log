Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.

Sarah:  Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?

Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?

Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?

Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.


Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?

Joe:  Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.


Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

**Previous Context**:
My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.

**Sarah:**  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.

**Joe:**  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.

**Sarah:** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?

**Joe:** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.

**Joe:**  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.

**Sarah:**  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.

**Joe:**  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.

**Sarah:** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?

**Joe:**  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.

**Sarah:**  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?

**Joe:**  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.  

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?

**Joe:** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.

**Sarah:**  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?

**Joe:** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.

**Sarah:**  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?

**Joe:** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.

**Sarah:** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

    "text": "** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers."

** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?

**Sarah:** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?

**Joe:**  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.

**Sarah:**  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?

**Joe:** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?

**Joe:**  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.

**Joe:**  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.

**Sarah:**  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.

**Joe:**  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?

**Joe:** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.

**Sarah:**  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.

**Sarah:** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.

**Joe:** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.


**Sarah:** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.


**Joe:** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.


**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?
[INFO] Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?
[INFO] Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?
[INFO] Joe: **  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?
[INFO] Joe: ** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?
[INFO] Sarah: ** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?
[INFO] Joe: **  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?
[INFO] Joe: ** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.
[INFO] Sarah: ** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, antibodies.  I've heard whispers about this being a big problem.  Um, can you explain what the issue is, in, you know, plain English?  I'm not a scientist.

Joe:  Sure, Sarah. So, scientists use antibodies, which are essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific things, like viruses, to, um, identify and measure specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as tiny, highly specific tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy and use in their labs—don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the *right* protein, or they might bind to multiple proteins, giving you inaccurate results.

Sarah:  So, they're like... faulty tools?  Giving you bad data?

Joe: Exactly!  And that's a huge problem.  It leads to wasted time, money, and, more importantly, potentially flawed research findings.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, found that, um, out of sixteen commercially available antibodies designed to target a specific protein related to motor neuron disease, only three actually worked correctly.  Fifteen others didn't even bind to the target protein.  And those fifteen faulty antibodies had been cited in over 3000 published papers!

Sarah:  Wow. Three thousand papers! That's... mind-boggling.  So, what causes this? Is it just bad manufacturing?

Joe:  It's a complex issue.  Part of it is the manufacturing process, for sure.  But it's also about the testing and validation of these antibodies.  Historically, there hasn't been enough rigorous testing to ensure the quality and specificity of these antibodies before they hit the market.  And, you know, it's not always easy to tell if an antibody is working correctly.  The methods for testing can be quite complicated.

Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?

Joe: Ah, that's where things get more hopeful.  There are several initiatives springing up.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS, which aims to thoroughly test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.  There are also efforts to improve the manufacturing processes and to encourage better practices within the scientific community.  Things like more rigorous testing and better transparency in reporting results.

Sarah:  It sounds like a huge collaborative effort is needed, then.  Vendors, researchers, funding agencies...everyone needs to be on board.

Joe: Absolutely. It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.  And, you know, it's not just about fixing the problem for future research.  There's also a need to revisit some of the existing research findings that might be based on unreliable antibodies.  It's a bit of a cleanup operation, but a necessary one for the advancement of scientific knowledge.

Sarah:  This is a really fascinating, and a bit alarming, look into the inner workings of scientific research. Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe.  It really highlights the importance of careful methodology and verification in science.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue that needs more attention, and I hope our listeners will find this conversation insightful.  Until next time, this is Science Odyssey signing off.

My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue that needs more attention, and I hope our listeners will find this conversation insightful.  Until next time, this is Science Odyssey signing off.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 **(Sound of a gentle transition, then silence)**

Joe: So, Sarah, picking up where we left off… the antibody validation crisis is a pretty significant problem, isn’t it?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a surprisingly large proportion simply don't perform as advertised.

Sarah: Exactly. It's astounding, really.  I mean, you're talking about the foundation of so much biological research.  And yet, we've had this massive proliferation of antibodies with questionable reliability.  This YCharOS initiative, though… it seems like a significant step forward.  But can you explain, in simple terms, what sets their approach apart?  I understand they're collaborating extensively with vendors, which is unusual.

Joe:  Right.  What makes YCharOS different is their scale and systematic approach.  They're not just testing a few antibodies here and there. They're actively engaging with a large number of antibody suppliers. This collaboration is key because the suppliers provide the antibodies for testing – free of charge.  And, you know, this level of cooperation is unprecedented.

Sarah:  That's…  a huge commitment from the vendors. What's the incentive for them?  Are they just being altruistic?  Or is there a strategic benefit?

Joe: Well, it’s a combination of things, I think.  Firstly,  participating helps ensure the quality of their products.  Identifying and fixing flawed antibodies benefits everyone in the long run –  it improves the reliability of research and ultimately, the reputation of the vendors themselves.  It's a bit of a self-regulating mechanism, if you will.  Also, the collaborative review process allows vendors to provide feedback before reports are published, which is valuable for them.

Sarah: So, it's a kind of quality control, but on a much larger and more collaborative scale than we've seen before.  What about their testing methodology?  You mentioned something about knock-out cell lines...

Joe:  Yes, their method is quite straightforward.  They compare antibody performance in two different cell lines: one that expresses the target protein normally, and a "knock-out" line that lacks the protein.  This allows them to directly assess the specificity of the antibody – its ability to bind *only* to the intended target.  The absence of binding in the knock-out cell line confirms that the antibody isn't picking up other things.

Sarah:  That sounds incredibly rigorous.  And the results, as you mentioned earlier, were... concerning?

Joe: To put it mildly. Their initial analysis showed that a significant percentage – two-thirds – of the antibodies tested didn't perform as claimed by the manufacturers.  That's a huge red flag for the entire research community.

Sarah:  It really is. And it highlights the importance of those negative controls, as the YCharOS director mentioned.  But how sustainable is this YCharOS model?  It seems like a massive undertaking.

Joe: That's a valid concern. The scale is certainly ambitious.  The long-term sustainability will depend on continued funding and, critically, the ongoing commitment from both the vendors and the funding bodies.  It's a large-scale effort, but if it can continue, it could dramatically improve the reliability of antibody-based research.  There are other initiatives like OMAPs, which focus on validation in different contexts, not just the basic specificity.  So it's not a single solution, but a multi-pronged approach is needed.

Sarah:  It sounds like a vital piece of the puzzle, though.  A much-needed quality control system for a crucial research tool.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe. That was incredibly clear.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it for our listeners.

My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it for our listeners.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the problems with antibody reliability.  It sounds incredibly frustrating.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers – as a step towards improvement.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  I’m still a little fuzzy on it.

Joe:  Sure.  Think of it like this... well, maybe not "think of it like this," because analogies can be misleading.  Basically, RRIDs are unique identifying codes for research resources, like antibodies.  Currently, companies often assign their own catalogue numbers to antibodies, which can change or even disappear if the company stops making that specific antibody.  Different companies might even use the same number for different antibodies.  It's a mess.  RRIDs are persistent, unique identifiers. They're like a permanent, globally recognized address for each antibody.  It makes it much easier to find and track down the exact antibody used in a study, improving reproducibility.

Sarah: So, it's essentially a standardized, permanent labeling system?  That makes a lot more sense.  But even with proper labeling, it sounds like a lot of antibodies aren't actually very good, even the ones that are widely cited.  What's the core issue there?  Is it just poor manufacturing?

Joe:  It's more complicated than just poor manufacturing, although that certainly plays a role.  The problem is that antibodies are used in so many different contexts – different species, different tissues, different experimental setups.  An antibody that works perfectly for one application might be completely useless for another.  There isn't a single, universally accepted validation method.  Some people emphasize "knock-out validation," but even that's not foolproof, and it's only done for a tiny percentage of antibodies.

Sarah:  So, there's no easy "good" or "bad" label we can just slap on an antibody? It really depends on the specific use case. That's a huge hurdle.

Joe: Exactly. And that’s why initiatives like CiteAb, which is a search engine for antibodies, are so important. They are trying to gather data on how different antibodies perform in various situations.  They're incorporating validation data, but again, it's a massive undertaking. It’s not just about the manufacturers, either; it’s a system-wide problem.

Sarah:  Right.  And then you mentioned this "Only Good Antibodies" community.  What's their approach?  Are they trying to create some kind of universal standard?

Joe:  Their approach is more collaborative. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers to work together on solutions.  They're not trying to impose a single standard, but to foster better communication and data sharing to improve the reliability of antibodies across the board. It’s a much needed holistic approach, you know?  It's about improving the whole process, not just one aspect of it.  It's a long-term project, but it's a crucial one.

Sarah:  It sounds like a monumental task.  But it's encouraging to hear about these initiatives trying to tackle this problem head-on.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly helpful.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: Wow, that's a lot to unpack.  So, Joe, let's try to simplify this.  You mentioned recombinant antibodies being a big deal. Can you explain what makes them different, and why they're such an improvement?

Joe:  Right.  So, traditionally, many antibodies were made using, um,  immune cells or hybridomas – basically, cells that produce antibodies naturally.  The problem is, this process is inherently variable.  Each batch of antibodies might be slightly different in terms of its purity and how effectively it binds to its target.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to make *only* a specific antibody. This means you get a consistent product every time, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe instead of a vague guideline.

Sarah:  So, it's the consistency that's key then?  Less variability means more reliable results in experiments?

Joe: Exactly.  Less variability translates directly to more reproducible results.  Think of it this way: if you're building something, you want consistent bricks, not bricks of varying sizes and shapes.  Inconsistent antibodies are like those inconsistent bricks – they make the whole research structure less reliable.

Sarah: Makes perfect sense.  But even with these improvements, you mentioned that getting scientists to actually *use* these better antibodies is a hurdle. Why is that?

Joe: Yeah, that's a huge challenge.  Some researchers might be hesitant to change established methods, even if there's evidence that a new method is superior.  There's also the issue of inertia –  if an antibody has worked for them in the past, they may not see the need to switch.  And let's be honest, sometimes it's just easier to stick with what you know. There's also the issue of publication bias – where papers using newer, potentially more reliable methods are less likely to be published because they don't show novel or exciting results.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of habit, convenience, and perhaps even some systemic issues within scientific publishing? That's... depressing, to be honest.

Joe:  It is, but there's also a lot of positive momentum. You know, initiatives like the ones we discussed are actively trying to address this.  Rewarding researchers for using better antibodies, improving data sharing... these are all steps in the right direction.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is already happening, albeit slowly.  And the younger generation of scientists seem more collaborative and open to adopting these best practices, which is very encouraging.  It's a slow burn, but progress is being made.

Sarah: That’s good to hear.  I think it's important for our listeners to understand that even within the scientific community, change doesn't happen overnight. It's a process of incremental improvements and overcoming resistance to change.  Thanks so much for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really insightful.

Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah: That’s good to hear.  I think it's important for our listeners to understand that even within the scientific community, change doesn't happen overnight. It's a process of incremental improvements and overcoming resistance to change.  Thanks so much for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really insightful.

Joe:  Yeah, absolutely.  And you're right, it's not like a light switch.  It’s… um…  a gradual process,  lots of small steps forward.  Speaking of which, we were talking about validating antibodies, right?  There are several key methods researchers use to check if an antibody is actually doing what it's supposed to.

Sarah: Right, the reliability of those antibodies.  So, you mentioned a few methods. Can you break them down a bit more for our listeners?  Maybe explain them in a way that isn't too… technical?

Joe: Okay, so, one common method is immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you're staining cells.  If the antibody is good, it will bind specifically to the protein you're interested in within those cells.  You can then see under a microscope which cells are expressing that protein.

Sarah:  So, it’s like… highlighting the protein?  A visual confirmation?

Joe:  Yeah, you could think of it that way, I guess.  But it's more precise than just highlighting.  It's about specific binding. Another method is Western blotting.  Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then the antibody is used to detect the protein of interest.  If the antibody is specific, it'll only bind to that one protein with a specific molecular weight.  You'll see a single band on the blot if it works.

Sarah:  So, a single band means the antibody is working correctly?  And if you get multiple bands, that's a problem?

Joe:  Exactly. Multiple bands usually means the antibody is binding to other things besides your target protein, which isn't ideal.  It lacks specificity.  And then there's immunoprecipitation.  This is where you use the antibody to physically pull out your protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the protein you pulled out.  It’s like fishing for a specific protein using the antibody as your bait.

Sarah:  Okay, that makes more sense now.  So, you're using multiple techniques to cross-validate, right?  To make sure the results are reliable and consistent?

Joe: Precisely.  Using multiple methods increases confidence in your findings.  It's all about building up evidence to support the antibody's reliability.

Sarah: It sounds like a lot of work!  And it highlights the importance of rigorous validation.  This really helps clarify the process for listeners.

Joe:  It is a lot of work, and that's why it's so crucial to get it right.  The reliability of the antibodies is fundamental to the entire research process. Um… you know… getting that wrong can throw off everything else.

Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for explaining that, Joe. This has been incredibly helpful.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, antibodies.  I've heard whispers about this being a big problem.  Um, can you explain what the issue is, in, you know, plain English?  I'm not a scientist.
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah. So, scientists use antibodies, which are essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific things, like viruses, to, um, identify and measure specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as tiny, highly specific tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy and use in their labs—don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the *right* protein, or they might bind to multiple proteins, giving you inaccurate results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, they're like... faulty tools?  Giving you bad data?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  And that's a huge problem.  It leads to wasted time, money, and, more importantly, potentially flawed research findings.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, found that, um, out of sixteen commercially available antibodies designed to target a specific protein related to motor neuron disease, only three actually worked correctly.  Fifteen others didn't even bind to the target protein.  And those fifteen faulty antibodies had been cited in over 3000 published papers!
[INFO] Joe: It's a complex issue.  Part of it is the manufacturing process, for sure.  But it's also about the testing and validation of these antibodies.  Historically, there hasn't been enough rigorous testing to ensure the quality and specificity of these antibodies before they hit the market.  And, you know, it's not always easy to tell if an antibody is working correctly.  The methods for testing can be quite complicated.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Three thousand papers! That's... mind-boggling.  So, what causes this? Is it just bad manufacturing?
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?
[INFO] Joe: Ah, that's where things get more hopeful.  There are several initiatives springing up.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS, which aims to thoroughly test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.  There are also efforts to improve the manufacturing processes and to encourage better practices within the scientific community.  Things like more rigorous testing and better transparency in reporting results.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a huge collaborative effort is needed, then.  Vendors, researchers, funding agencies...everyone needs to be on board.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.  And, you know, it's not just about fixing the problem for future research.  There's also a need to revisit some of the existing research findings that might be based on unreliable antibodies.  It's a bit of a cleanup operation, but a necessary one for the advancement of scientific knowledge.
[INFO] Sarah: This is a really fascinating, and a bit alarming, look into the inner workings of scientific research. Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe.  It really highlights the importance of careful methodology and verification in science.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue that needs more attention, and I hope our listeners will find this conversation insightful.  Until next time, this is Science Odyssey signing off.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, picking up where we left off… the antibody validation crisis is a pretty significant problem, isn’t it?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a surprisingly large proportion simply don't perform as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly. It's astounding, really.  I mean, you're talking about the foundation of so much biological research.  And yet, we've had this massive proliferation of antibodies with questionable reliability.  This YCharOS initiative, though… it seems like a significant step forward.  But can you explain, in simple terms, what sets their approach apart?  I understand they're collaborating extensively with vendors, which is unusual.
[INFO] Joe: Right.  What makes YCharOS different is their scale and systematic approach.  They're not just testing a few antibodies here and there. They're actively engaging with a large number of antibody suppliers. This collaboration is key because the suppliers provide the antibodies for testing – free of charge.  And, you know, this level of cooperation is unprecedented.
[INFO] Sarah: That's…  a huge commitment from the vendors. What's the incentive for them?  Are they just being altruistic?  Or is there a strategic benefit?
[INFO] Joe: Well, it’s a combination of things, I think.  Firstly,  participating helps ensure the quality of their products.  Identifying and fixing flawed antibodies benefits everyone in the long run –  it improves the reliability of research and ultimately, the reputation of the vendors themselves.  It's a bit of a self-regulating mechanism, if you will.  Also, the collaborative review process allows vendors to provide feedback before reports are published, which is valuable for them.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a kind of quality control, but on a much larger and more collaborative scale than we've seen before.  What about their testing methodology?  You mentioned something about knock-out cell lines...
[INFO] Joe: Yes, their method is quite straightforward.  They compare antibody performance in two different cell lines: one that expresses the target protein normally, and a "knock-out" line that lacks the protein.  This allows them to directly assess the specificity of the antibody – its ability to bind *only* to the intended target.  The absence of binding in the knock-out cell line confirms that the antibody isn't picking up other things.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds incredibly rigorous.  And the results, as you mentioned earlier, were... concerning?
[INFO] Joe: To put it mildly. Their initial analysis showed that a significant percentage – two-thirds – of the antibodies tested didn't perform as claimed by the manufacturers.  That's a huge red flag for the entire research community.
[INFO] Sarah: It really is. And it highlights the importance of those negative controls, as the YCharOS director mentioned.  But how sustainable is this YCharOS model?  It seems like a massive undertaking.
[INFO] Joe: That's a valid concern. The scale is certainly ambitious.  The long-term sustainability will depend on continued funding and, critically, the ongoing commitment from both the vendors and the funding bodies.  It's a large-scale effort, but if it can continue, it could dramatically improve the reliability of antibody-based research.  There are other initiatives like OMAPs, which focus on validation in different contexts, not just the basic specificity.  So it's not a single solution, but a multi-pronged approach is needed.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a vital piece of the puzzle, though.  A much-needed quality control system for a crucial research tool.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe. That was incredibly clear.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it for our listeners.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the problems with antibody reliability.  It sounds incredibly frustrating.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers – as a step towards improvement.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  I’m still a little fuzzy on it.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's essentially a standardized, permanent labeling system?  That makes a lot more sense.  But even with proper labeling, it sounds like a lot of antibodies aren't actually very good, even the ones that are widely cited.  What's the core issue there?  Is it just poor manufacturing?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Think of it like this... well, maybe not "think of it like this," because analogies can be misleading.  Basically, RRIDs are unique identifying codes for research resources, like antibodies.  Currently, companies often assign their own catalogue numbers to antibodies, which can change or even disappear if the company stops making that specific antibody.  Different companies might even use the same number for different antibodies.  It's a mess.  RRIDs are persistent, unique identifiers. They're like a permanent, globally recognized address for each antibody.  It makes it much easier to find and track down the exact antibody used in a study, improving reproducibility.
[INFO] Joe: It's more complicated than just poor manufacturing, although that certainly plays a role.  The problem is that antibodies are used in so many different contexts – different species, different tissues, different experimental setups.  An antibody that works perfectly for one application might be completely useless for another.  There isn't a single, universally accepted validation method.  Some people emphasize "knock-out validation," but even that's not foolproof, and it's only done for a tiny percentage of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: So, there's no easy "good" or "bad" label we can just slap on an antibody? It really depends on the specific use case. That's a huge hurdle.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. And that’s why initiatives like CiteAb, which is a search engine for antibodies, are so important. They are trying to gather data on how different antibodies perform in various situations.  They're incorporating validation data, but again, it's a massive undertaking. It’s not just about the manufacturers, either; it’s a system-wide problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  And then you mentioned this "Only Good Antibodies" community.  What's their approach?  Are they trying to create some kind of universal standard?
[INFO] Joe: Their approach is more collaborative. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers to work together on solutions.  They're not trying to impose a single standard, but to foster better communication and data sharing to improve the reliability of antibodies across the board. It’s a much needed holistic approach, you know?  It's about improving the whole process, not just one aspect of it.  It's a long-term project, but it's a crucial one.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task.  But it's encouraging to hear about these initiatives trying to tackle this problem head-on.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly helpful.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a lot to unpack.  So, Joe, let's try to simplify this.  You mentioned recombinant antibodies being a big deal. Can you explain what makes them different, and why they're such an improvement?
[INFO] Joe: Right.  So, traditionally, many antibodies were made using, um,  immune cells or hybridomas – basically, cells that produce antibodies naturally.

Inconsistent antibodies are like those inconsistent bricks – they make the whole research structure less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: Makes perfect sense.  But even with these improvements, you mentioned that getting scientists to actually *use* these better antibodies is a hurdle. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's a huge challenge.  Some researchers might be hesitant to change established methods, even if there's evidence that a new method is superior.  There's also the issue of inertia –  if an antibody has worked for them in the past, they may not see the need to switch.  And let's be honest, sometimes it's just easier to stick with what you know. There's also the issue of publication bias – where papers using newer, potentially more reliable methods are less likely to be published because they don't show novel or exciting results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of habit, convenience, and perhaps even some systemic issues within scientific publishing? That's... depressing, to be honest.

[INFO] Sarah: That’s good to hear.  I think it's important for our listeners to understand that even within the scientific community, change doesn't happen overnight. It's a process of incremental improvements and overcoming resistance to change.  Thanks so much for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really insightful.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating, area of biological research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies that are plaguing, um, a lot of scientific work.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers of this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that directly tied to faulty antibodies?

Joe:  Yeah, it's a big part of it.  See, scientists use antibodies all the time to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as really tiny, highly specific tags.  But, and this is a big but, many commercial antibodies – the ones researchers buy – just don't work as advertised. They might not bind to the *correct* protein, or they might bind to multiple proteins, giving you completely inaccurate results.

Sarah:  So, they're essentially giving false positives or negatives?  That's… pretty problematic.  How did this even become such a widespread issue?

Joe:  Well, for a long time, scientists made their own antibodies. It was a labor-intensive process, but you had more control over quality.  But then commercial production took off, and, um, quality control wasn't always, shall we say,  top priority.  Plus, there wasn't a really standardized way of testing these antibodies before they hit the market.

Sarah:  So it was kind of the Wild West of antibody production?

Joe:  Exactly!  The Wild West.  And the consequences are huge.  We're talking wasted time, wasted resources, and, you know, potentially flawed research that could lead to incorrect conclusions. One researcher, Carl Laflamme, discovered that of sixteen commercially available antibodies for one specific protein, only three actually worked correctly.  And those three weren't even the ones most commonly used in published papers!

Sarah: Wow.  So papers that had been cited thousands of times were potentially based on faulty data? That's incredibly concerning.  So what's being done to fix this?

Joe:  Ah, that's where the good news comes in.  There's a growing movement to improve antibody quality and validation.  There are initiatives like iCharOS, which aims to characterize every commercially available antibody for human proteins.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards greater reliability.  They're essentially systematically testing all these antibodies to see how well they actually perform.

Sarah:  That sounds incredibly important.  Is it just about better testing, or are there improvements in the actual production process as well?

Joe:  Both.  There are efforts to improve the production methods to create more reliable antibodies from the outset.  It's a multi-pronged approach: better testing, better production, and, importantly, a shift in the culture of research to prioritize rigorous validation of reagents.

Sarah: So, it's a whole system overhaul.  It seems like there's a lot of hope for more reliable research in the future.  This is definitely something that needs to be addressed. Thanks, Joe!

Joe:  Absolutely, Sarah.  And it's a story that highlights how even the most fundamental tools in science need constant scrutiny and improvement.  Thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey!

**Previous Context**:
Absolutely, Sarah.  And it's a story that highlights how even the most fundamental tools in science need constant scrutiny and improvement.  Thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey!

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, the antibody story is a fascinating one, isn't it?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a surprisingly large percentage… well, let's just say they don't always perform as advertised.  The problem stems from the inherent complexity of antibody-antigen interactions. You're not just dealing with a simple lock-and-key mechanism; there are all sorts of factors influencing binding affinity and specificity.  Things like post-translational modifications of the target protein, the surrounding cellular environment… it all matters.

Sarah:  Right, and that's what makes initiatives like YCharOS so crucial, right?  They're essentially providing a much-needed quality control check. But it sounds like they're focusing on a specific kind of testing – comparing performance in a cell line with and without the target protein.  Is that a limitation?  I mean, how reliable is that as a predictor of how the antibody will behave in, say, a completely different tissue sample?

Joe: That's a very good point, Sarah.  It *is* a limitation.  Their method, while rigorous within its parameters, focuses on a controlled environment.  Think of it like this:  they're testing the antibody's performance under very specific, standardized conditions.  But the real world is far messier. Different tissues, different cellular contexts… the target protein might be modified differently, expressed at different levels, or even interact with other proteins that influence antibody binding.  So, while YCharOS provides valuable data, it doesn't guarantee perfect performance across all applications.

Sarah:  So, it's kind of like… a baseline test?  A good starting point, but not the whole picture?

Joe:  Exactly. It gives you a strong indication of the antibody's fundamental properties, its specificity and selectivity under controlled conditions.  But it's not a complete validation for every possible use case.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in, offering a more diverse, community-based approach.  They're testing across different tissues and methods, acknowledging the inherent variability.

Sarah: Hmm, so YCharOS is more focused on the intrinsic properties of the antibody, while OMAPs is looking at its performance in various contexts.  That’s a helpful distinction. It seems like a complementary approach, rather than one being inherently "better."  Are there other factors that contribute to antibody unreliability besides the ones you mentioned?  I mean, is there a manufacturing issue, perhaps?

Joe:  Absolutely.  Manufacturing variability is a significant factor.  Slight changes in the production process can affect the antibody's quality and consistency.  Think batch-to-batch variation; even slight differences can impact performance.  And then there's the issue of proper storage and handling.  Antibodies are delicate molecules, and improper storage can lead to degradation, affecting their functionality.  So it's not just about the inherent properties of the antibody itself; it's the entire process, from production to use, that contributes to reliability.

Sarah:  Wow, it’s a lot more complicated than I initially thought!  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It really highlights the need for ongoing quality control and standardization within the field.

Wow, it’s a lot more complicated than I initially thought!  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It really highlights the need for ongoing quality control and standardization within the field.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: Wow, it’s a lot more complicated than I initially thought! Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe. It really highlights the need for ongoing quality control and standardization within the field.

Joe: Yeah, it's a mess, to be honest.  Um, even if you *do* find good antibodies,  locating them is a huge hurdle.  Take this study from 2009...  Researchers looked at journal articles, specifically in *The Journal of Neuroscience*, and found that a shocking 90% of the antibodies cited didn't even have a catalogue number.  You know, that code vendors use to identify their products?  Without that, it's almost impossible to track them down.  To replicate an experiment, you need the right reagents, and proper labeling is absolutely critical.

Sarah:  So, essentially,  a huge reproducibility problem stemming from a simple lack of consistent identification?

Joe: Exactly.  That's why things like RRIDs—research resource identifiers—were developed. They're unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other research resources.  Catalogue numbers can disappear if a company stops producing a product, or, even worse, two different products might accidentally share the same number. RRIDs solve that.  It's a significant step towards better tracking. They started a pilot project with journals in 2014, and now, you know, over a thousand journals request these identifiers.  It's a big improvement, but it's only one piece of the puzzle.

Sarah:  Right, because even if you *can* find the antibody, there's still the issue of its reliability, right?

Joe: Absolutely.  There's CiteAb, a search engine that helps researchers find highly cited antibodies.  It's got millions of antibodies listed, and they're starting to include validation information.  The problem is, antibodies are used in so many different ways, with so many different species, that you can't just simply say an antibody is "good" or "bad".  It's context-dependent.  Knock-out validation is often cited as the gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have that kind of validation.

Sarah:  So, it's a real challenge to establish a universal standard of quality.  It sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.

Joe:  It is.  I mean, one researcher, Virk, even considered leaving science because of his experience with unreliable antibodies.  He was working on a big grant, studying a protein called TRPA1, and discovered that two out of the three most-cited antibodies for that protein didn't even detect the human protein correctly! One even detected several other proteins.  That's a huge problem.  That's why he co-founded the Only Good Antibodies community.  It brings together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, publishers - everyone involved – to try and tackle this issue.

Sarah: That's a really positive step, though.  A collaborative effort to address the problem head-on.  It sounds like a multi-faceted issue requiring a multi-faceted solution.

Joe: Precisely. It's not just about one thing, it's about improving identification, improving validation methods, and fostering better communication and collaboration across the entire research community. It's a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like RRIDs and OGA are paving the way for a more reliable future.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's a multifaceted problem, isn't it?  We've talked about RRIDs and OGA, but the shift towards recombinant antibodies is a huge part of the solution.

Sarah: Right. And it's fascinating how much of a shift we're seeing.  But can you explain again, in simple terms, why recombinant antibodies are better?  I mean, I get the "genetically engineered cells" part, but what's the real practical difference for a researcher?

Joe:  Okay, so the older methods—using antibodies from immune cells or hybridomas—are inherently variable. Each batch of antibodies produced can have slight differences in its structure and, therefore, its effectiveness.  Think of it like baking a cake without a precise recipe: each cake might be *somewhat* similar, but not identical. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced from a consistent, defined genetic sequence. It's like having that perfect, precise recipe. Every batch is essentially identical, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in experiments.

Sarah:  So, less variation means more reliable results.  That makes perfect sense.  But it sounds like a big shift for manufacturers, too.  Is it expensive to switch over?

Joe:  It is a significant investment, yes.  It requires changing production processes and infrastructure. But the long-term benefits – improved reproducibility, reduced costs associated with failed experiments due to unreliable antibodies, and increased user satisfaction – seem to outweigh the initial investment for many manufacturers.  Plus, the market demand is pushing them in this direction.  There’s a clear business incentive.

Sarah: You mentioned user feedback being positive. What kind of feedback are we talking about here?

Joe:  Well, researchers are reporting more consistent results, which is the main thing.  Fewer experiments are failing because of antibody issues. That translates directly to saved time and resources.  It’s less troubleshooting and more focusing on the actual research questions.

Sarah:  That’s a huge improvement. So, even though changing researcher behavior is a challenge, the industry is actively working on solutions from multiple angles.  It sounds like a complex, systemic problem, needing a community-wide effort to solve it, not just a technical fix.

Joe: Exactly.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about data sharing, improved validation methods, and a cultural shift towards transparency and collaboration within the scientific community.  The initiatives we discussed, like OGA, are aiming to address all of these facets.  It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I think we're seeing real progress.  Um... you know... it's slow, but it's moving in the right direction.

Sarah:  It's encouraging to hear that, Joe.  Thanks for clarifying all of this.  It's a complicated issue, but you've made it much clearer.

Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah: It's encouraging to hear that, Joe. Thanks for clarifying all of this. It's a complicated issue, but you've made it much clearer.  So, let's recap.  We've talked about three main ways to validate antibodies, right? Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.

Joe: Yeah, exactly.  Three main methods, although there are other techniques, of course.  Um...  But those three are pretty standard.  Immunohistochemistry,  that's where you're essentially looking at the location of a protein within a tissue sample. You use the antibody to, you know, "light up" the cells expressing that protein.

Sarah: So, it's like a visual confirmation?  You can actually *see* where the protein is?

Joe:  Precisely.  You stain the cells, and under a microscope, you see which cells are positive for the protein of interest.  It's a relatively straightforward technique, but interpretation can be tricky sometimes.

Sarah:  Okay.  And Western blotting? That sounds... less visual.

Joe:  Right.  Western blotting is different. It's more about confirming the *size* and *presence* of the protein.  You separate proteins by size using a gel, then transfer them to a membrane, and then use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  You get a band on the membrane – a single band, ideally – at the expected molecular weight.  If it's there, it suggests your antibody is specific.

Sarah:  So, you're looking for a specific band on a gel, indicating the protein's molecular weight.  And that matches the weight you *expect* the protein to have?

Joe:  Exactly.  It's a bit like a fingerprint for the protein.  If you get multiple bands, or a band at the wrong weight, it suggests the antibody might be binding to other things too – which is not ideal.

Sarah:  And finally, immunoprecipitation.  That sounds the most… involved?

Joe: It is a bit more complex. You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it like fishing; the antibody is your bait, and the protein is the fish.  Then, you can analyze what you've caught using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.

Sarah: So you're not just looking for a band, you're actually identifying the protein itself?

Joe:  Yes. Mass spectrometry gives you a very precise identification. It's a powerful technique, but it's also more expensive and requires specialized equipment.

Sarah:  So, all three methods provide different but complementary information about the antibody's specificity.  And ideally, researchers would use a combination of these techniques, right?  To get a more robust validation?

Joe: Absolutely.  Using multiple methods significantly strengthens the confidence in the antibody's reliability. It's all about minimizing the chance of false positives or false negatives.  You know,  science is all about rigorous validation.

Sarah: It certainly sounds like it! Thanks for explaining that so clearly, Joe.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It's important to understand these validation steps. Without them, the scientific results can be… well, less reliable.

Sarah:  Definitely.  This has been incredibly helpful.

[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating, area of biological research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies that are plaguing, um, a lot of scientific work.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a big part of it.  See, scientists use antibodies all the time to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as really tiny, highly specific tags.  But, and this is a big but, many commercial antibodies – the ones researchers buy – just don't work as advertised. They might not bind to the *correct* protein, or they might bind to multiple proteins, giving you completely inaccurate results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, they're essentially giving false positives or negatives?  That's… pretty problematic.  How did this even become such a widespread issue?
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers of this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that directly tied to faulty antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Well, for a long time, scientists made their own antibodies. It was a labor-intensive process, but you had more control over quality.  But then commercial production took off, and, um, quality control wasn't always, shall we say,  top priority.  Plus, there wasn't a really standardized way of testing these antibodies before they hit the market.
[INFO] Sarah: So it was kind of the Wild West of antibody production?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  The Wild West.  And the consequences are huge.  We're talking wasted time, wasted resources, and, you know, potentially flawed research that could lead to incorrect conclusions. One researcher, Carl Laflamme, discovered that of sixteen commercially available antibodies for one specific protein, only three actually worked correctly.  And those three weren't even the ones most commonly used in published papers!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow.  So papers that had been cited thousands of times were potentially based on faulty data? That's incredibly concerning.  So what's being done to fix this?
[INFO] Joe: Ah, that's where the good news comes in.  There's a growing movement to improve antibody quality and validation.  There are initiatives like iCharOS, which aims to characterize every commercially available antibody for human proteins.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards greater reliability.  They're essentially systematically testing all these antibodies to see how well they actually perform.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds incredibly important.  Is it just about better testing, or are there improvements in the actual production process as well?
[INFO] Joe: Both.  There are efforts to improve the production methods to create more reliable antibodies from the outset.  It's a multi-pronged approach: better testing, better production, and, importantly, a shift in the culture of research to prioritize rigorous validation of reagents.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a whole system overhaul.  It seems like there's a lot of hope for more reliable research in the future.  This is definitely something that needs to be addressed. Thanks, Joe!
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely, Sarah.  And it's a story that highlights how even the most fundamental tools in science need constant scrutiny and improvement.  Thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey!
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, the antibody story is a fascinating one, isn't it?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a surprisingly large percentage… well, let's just say they don't always perform as advertised.  The problem stems from the inherent complexity of antibody-antigen interactions. You're not just dealing with a simple lock-and-key mechanism; there are all sorts of factors influencing binding affinity and specificity.  Things like post-translational modifications of the target protein, the surrounding cellular environment… it all matters.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, and that's what makes initiatives like YCharOS so crucial, right?  They're essentially providing a much-needed quality control check. But it sounds like they're focusing on a specific kind of testing – comparing performance in a cell line with and without the target protein.  Is that a limitation?  I mean, how reliable is that as a predictor of how the antibody will behave in, say, a completely different tissue sample?
[INFO] Joe: That's a very good point, Sarah.  It *is* a limitation.  Their method, while rigorous within its parameters, focuses on a controlled environment.  Think of it like this:  they're testing the antibody's performance under very specific, standardized conditions.  But the real world is far messier. Different tissues, different cellular contexts… the target protein might be modified differently, expressed at different levels, or even interact with other proteins that influence antibody binding.  So, while YCharOS provides valuable data, it doesn't guarantee perfect performance across all applications.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's kind of like… a baseline test?  A good starting point, but not the whole picture?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. It gives you a strong indication of the antibody's fundamental properties, its specificity and selectivity under controlled conditions.  But it's not a complete validation for every possible use case.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in, offering a more diverse, community-based approach.  They're testing across different tissues and methods, acknowledging the inherent variability.
[INFO] Sarah: Hmm, so YCharOS is more focused on the intrinsic properties of the antibody, while OMAPs is looking at its performance in various contexts.  That’s a helpful distinction. It seems like a complementary approach, rather than one being inherently "better."  Are there other factors that contribute to antibody unreliability besides the ones you mentioned?  I mean, is there a manufacturing issue, perhaps?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  Manufacturing variability is a significant factor.  Slight changes in the production process can affect the antibody's quality and consistency.  Think batch-to-batch variation; even slight differences can impact performance.  And then there's the issue of proper storage and handling.  Antibodies are delicate molecules, and improper storage can lead to degradation, affecting their functionality.  So it's not just about the inherent properties of the antibody itself; it's the entire process, from production to use, that contributes to reliability.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, it’s a lot more complicated than I initially thought!  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It really highlights the need for ongoing quality control and standardization within the field.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, it’s a lot more complicated than I initially thought! Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe. It really highlights the need for ongoing quality control and standardization within the field.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a mess, to be honest.  Um, even if you *do* find good antibodies,  locating them is a huge hurdle.  Take this study from 2009...  Researchers looked at journal articles, specifically in *The Journal of Neuroscience*, and found that a shocking 90% of the antibodies cited didn't even have a catalogue number.  You know, that code vendors use to identify their products?  Without that, it's almost impossible to track them down.  To replicate an experiment, you need the right reagents, and proper labeling is absolutely critical.
[INFO] Sarah: So, essentially,  a huge reproducibility problem stemming from a simple lack of consistent identification?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  That's why things like RRIDs—research resource identifiers—were developed. They're unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other research resources.  Catalogue numbers can disappear if a company stops producing a product, or, even worse, two different products might accidentally share the same number. RRIDs solve that.  It's a significant step towards better tracking. They started a pilot project with journals in 2014, and now, you know, over a thousand journals request these identifiers.  It's a big improvement, but it's only one piece of the puzzle.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, because even if you *can* find the antibody, there's still the issue of its reliability, right?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  There's CiteAb, a search engine that helps researchers find highly cited antibodies.  It's got millions of antibodies listed, and they're starting to include validation information.  The problem is, antibodies are used in so many different ways, with so many different species, that you can't just simply say an antibody is "good" or "bad".  It's context-dependent.  Knock-out validation is often cited as the gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have that kind of validation.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a real challenge to establish a universal standard of quality.  It sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.
[INFO] Joe: It is.  I mean, one researcher, Virk, even considered leaving science because of his experience with unreliable antibodies.  He was working on a big grant, studying a protein called TRPA1, and discovered that two out of the three most-cited antibodies for that protein didn't even detect the human protein correctly! One even detected several other proteins.  That's a huge problem.  That's why he co-founded the Only Good Antibodies community.  It brings together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, publishers - everyone involved – to try and tackle this issue.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a really positive step, though.  A collaborative effort to address the problem head-on.  It sounds like a multi-faceted issue requiring a multi-faceted solution.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely. It's not just about one thing, it's about improving identification, improving validation methods, and fostering better communication and collaboration across the entire research community. It's a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like RRIDs and OGA are paving the way for a more reliable future.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody reproducibility crisis.  It's a multifaceted problem, isn't it?  We've talked about RRIDs and OGA, but the shift towards recombinant antibodies is a huge part of the solution.
[INFO] Sarah: Right. And it's fascinating how much of a shift we're seeing.  But can you explain again, in simple terms, why recombinant antibodies are better?  I mean, I get the "genetically engineered cells" part, but what's the real practical difference for a researcher?
[INFO] Joe: Okay, so the older methods—using antibodies from immune cells or hybridomas—are inherently variable. Each batch of antibodies produced can have slight differences in its structure and, therefore, its effectiveness.  Think of it like baking a cake without a precise recipe: each cake might be *somewhat* similar, but not identical. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced from a consistent, defined genetic sequence. It's like having that perfect, precise recipe. Every batch is essentially identical, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: So, less variation means more reliable results.  That makes perfect sense.  But it sounds like a big shift for manufacturers, too.  Is it expensive to switch over?
[INFO] Joe: It is a significant investment, yes.  It requires changing production processes and infrastructure. But the long-term benefits – improved reproducibility, reduced costs associated with failed experiments due to unreliable antibodies, and increased user satisfaction – seem to outweigh the initial investment for many manufacturers.  Plus, the market demand is pushing them in this direction.  There’s a clear business incentive.
[INFO] Sarah: You mentioned user feedback being positive. What kind of feedback are we talking about here?
[INFO] Joe: Well, researchers are reporting more consistent results, which is the main thing.  Fewer experiments are failing because of antibody issues. That translates directly to saved time and resources.  It’s less troubleshooting and more focusing on the actual research questions.
[INFO] Sarah: That’s a huge improvement. So, even though changing researcher behavior is a challenge, the industry is actively working on solutions from multiple angles.  It sounds like a complex, systemic problem, needing a community-wide effort to solve it, not just a technical fix.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about data sharing, improved validation methods, and a cultural shift towards transparency and collaboration within the scientific community.  The initiatives we discussed, like OGA, are aiming to address all of these facets.  It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I think we're seeing real progress.  Um... you know... it's slow, but it's moving in the right direction.
[INFO] Sarah: It's encouraging to hear that, Joe.  Thanks for clarifying all of this.  It's a complicated issue, but you've made it much clearer.
[INFO] Sarah: It's encouraging to hear that, Joe. Thanks for clarifying all of this. It's a complicated issue, but you've made it much clearer.  So, let's recap.  We've talked about three main ways to validate antibodies, right? Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, exactly.  Three main methods, although there are other techniques, of course.  Um...  But those three are pretty standard.  Immunohistochemistry,  that's where you're essentially looking at the location of a protein within a tissue sample. You use the antibody to, you know, "light up" the cells expressing that protein.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like a visual confirmation?  You can actually *see* where the protein is?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  You stain the cells, and under a microscope, you see which cells are positive for the protein of interest.  It's a relatively straightforward technique, but interpretation can be tricky sometimes.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay.  And Western blotting? That sounds... less visual.
[INFO] Joe: Right.  Western blotting is different. It's more about confirming the *size* and *presence* of the protein.  You separate proteins by size using a gel, then transfer them to a membrane, and then use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size.  You get a band on the membrane – a single band, ideally – at the expected molecular weight.  If it's there, it suggests your antibody is specific.
[INFO] Sarah: So, you're looking for a specific band on a gel, indicating the protein's molecular weight.  And that matches the weight you *expect* the protein to have?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a bit like a fingerprint for the protein.  If you get multiple bands, or a band at the wrong weight, it suggests the antibody might be binding to other things too – which is not ideal.
[INFO] Sarah: And finally, immunoprecipitation.  That sounds the most… involved?
[INFO] Joe: It is a bit more complex. You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it like fishing; the antibody is your bait, and the protein is the fish.  Then, you can analyze what you've caught using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.
[INFO] Sarah: So you're not just looking for a band, you're actually identifying the protein itself?
[INFO] Joe: Yes. Mass spectrometry gives you a very precise identification. It's a powerful technique, but it's also more expensive and requires specialized equipment.
[INFO] Sarah: So, all three methods provide different but complementary information about the antibody's specificity.  And ideally, researchers would use a combination of these techniques, right?  To get a more robust validation?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  Using multiple methods significantly strengthens the confidence in the antibody's reliability. It's all about minimizing the chance of false positives or false negatives.  You know,  science is all about rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: It certainly sounds like it! Thanks for explaining that so clearly, Joe.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's important to understand these validation steps. Without them, the scientific results can be… well, less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: Definitely.  This has been incredibly helpful.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific studies.

Sarah:  Oh, I'm familiar with the frustration! I've heard whispers, you know, about the reproducibility crisis in science, and I've always wondered how much of that stemmed from issues like this.  So, what's the core problem with these antibodies?

Joe:  Um, well, the core problem is that many commercially available antibodies, the ones scientists use to, ah, identify and measure specific proteins in cells, just don't work as advertised. They either don't bind to the target protein properly, or worse, they bind to lots of other things, giving you completely inaccurate results.  Think of it like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach with a magnet that also attracts pebbles and seashells – you're not going to get a very accurate count of sand grains.

Sarah:  Right, so it's a specificity and selectivity issue.  They're not precise enough.  But how widespread is this problem?  Is this just a few bad apples, or is it a significant issue affecting a lot of research?

Joe: It's a huge issue, Sarah.  One study we're discussing today highlights this perfectly.  A researcher, Carl Laflamme, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He looked at sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein. Only *three* actually worked as intended.  And get this – fifteen papers used an antibody that didn't even bind to the right protein!  Those papers were cited over 3,000 times!

Sarah: Wow. Three thousand citations based on faulty data. That's... staggering.  So, what are the consequences of using these unreliable antibodies?

Joe:  Well, it's a massive waste of time and resources, for starters.  Researchers spend months, sometimes years, pursuing research based on faulty data. It also contributes to the reproducibility crisis, making it harder to verify results and slowing down scientific progress.  Think about the implications for drug development – if your initial findings are based on flawed data from unreliable antibodies, your entire drug development pathway could be wrong.

Sarah: That's terrifying.  So, what's being done to address this? Is there hope?

Joe: There is hope! There are several initiatives springing up.  One is called iCharOS, which aims to rigorously test every commercially available antibody for human proteins.  It's a huge undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards establishing a more reliable database of antibodies.  There's also a push to improve antibody production, make it easier for researchers to find well-characterized antibodies, and of course, to encourage better practices in selecting and using them.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah: It sounds like a much-needed overhaul.  It's a bit daunting, but hopefully, these initiatives can make a real difference and help restore some confidence in the reliability of research.  This has been a really eye-opening discussion, Joe. Thanks for shedding light on this important issue.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a critical issue, and hopefully, bringing it to light will help spur further change.  And that’s all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time!

My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a critical issue, and hopefully, bringing it to light will help spur further change.  And that’s all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time!

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were talking about the YCharOS initiative and the huge problem of unreliable antibodies in research.  It's... it's a bigger deal than most people realize.  We're talking millions of antibody products, many of which simply don't perform as advertised.

**Sarah:** Right. And that's terrifying, considering how much research relies on these things.  I mean, a faulty antibody could completely derail a study, right?  And it's not just one or two, it's, what, two-thirds failing in some studies? That’s a staggering number.  But what exactly *is* the problem?  Is it just poor manufacturing?

**Joe:**  It's multifaceted.  Part of it is manufacturing, certainly.  Quality control can be inconsistent across suppliers. But a bigger issue is the inherent complexity of antibody-antigen interactions.  An antibody's specificity – its ability to bind *only* to its intended target – is affected by many factors.  The concentration of the target protein in the sample, the presence of other proteins that might interfere, even the specific method used to detect the binding – all these things influence the results.

**Sarah:** So, it's not just a simple "this antibody binds to this protein" scenario?  It's more nuanced than that.

**Joe:** Exactly.  Think of it like this –  (pause) Okay, maybe one analogy:  imagine trying to fit a key into a lock.  A well-made antibody is like a precisely crafted key that fits only one specific lock (the target protein). But if the lock is damaged, or if there's dirt in the keyhole, or if you're using the wrong kind of key, it might not work as expected.  That's a simplification, of course, but it illustrates the point.  The interaction is incredibly sensitive to its environment.

**Sarah:**  So, YCharOS is essentially trying to standardize the testing process, right?  Making sure that, you know, the "key" actually fits the "lock" under various controlled conditions.  But how do they do that?  It's not like they can test every single application of every antibody.

**Joe:**  They focus on a standardized test, comparing the antibody's performance in a cell line expressing the target protein to its performance in a knockout cell line lacking the protein.  This helps isolate the antibody's specificity.  It's not a complete solution, because, as you pointed out, the real-world application can be vastly different, but it's a significant step towards improving reliability. They're essentially creating a baseline – a minimum standard of performance.

**Sarah:**  And the collaboration with antibody manufacturers is key, isn't it?  Getting them on board to participate in the testing and to act on the findings. That's a huge achievement.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  Without that cooperation, the impact would be severely limited.  It shows a real commitment to improving the quality of research tools.  It's a collaborative effort to address a systemic problem.

**Sarah:**  So, it's not a perfect solution, but it's a crucial step forward.  It highlights the need for transparency and rigorous validation in scientific research – something that, frankly, is often overlooked.  This whole situation really underscores the importance of critical evaluation of reagents.


**Joe:** Precisely.  And the work of groups like YCharOS and OMAPs –  they're vital for ensuring the reliability of the foundation upon which so much research is built.  It's a continuous process, though.  There's always more work to be done.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we were talking about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  This whole RRID system... it sounds incredibly important, but can you break it down for someone who's not a scientist?

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  Imagine you're following a recipe, right?  You need specific ingredients.  Antibodies are like those ingredients in scientific research.  RRIDs are basically unique identifiers – like product codes – for these antibodies.  Before RRIDs,  many researchers cited antibodies without a reliable way to identify the *exact* batch used in a study.  A company might discontinue a product, or the same code might be used for different products.  RRIDs prevent that ambiguity.  They're persistent identifiers, so even if a company changes something, the RRID remains linked to the specific antibody used. It's a crucial step towards reproducibility.

Sarah:  Okay, so it's like a permanent, universal barcode for antibodies. That makes sense. But even if you *can* find the antibody, how do you know it's actually doing what it's supposed to be doing?  This article mentions CiteAb...

Joe: Right.  CiteAb is a search engine, specifically for antibodies.  It helps researchers find antibodies based on citations – how often they've been used in published papers.  That's a *hint* that they might be reliable, because they've been used successfully (at least seemingly) by other researchers. But it's not foolproof.  They also try to include validation data where available, which is even better.  You know,  showing that an antibody specifically targets the intended protein and nothing else is crucial.

Sarah:  So, more citations = potentially better, but not guaranteed?  It seems like there's still a huge problem with validation.  The article mentioned this "knock-out validation"... what's that?

Joe:  Yeah, it's not guaranteed at all.  Knock-out validation is a rigorous method. You essentially remove the target protein from a cell or organism and then see if the antibody still detects something. If it doesn't detect anything, it's a strong indication that the antibody is specific to that target protein. It's the gold standard, but as the article points out, less than 5% of antibodies have this level of validation.  It's a very resource-intensive process.

Sarah:  Wow, that's... disheartening.  So, what's the solution?  It sounds like a huge systemic problem.

Joe:  It is a systemic problem.  That's why initiatives like OGA – Only Good Antibodies – are so important.  They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, publishers – everyone involved – to try and improve things.  It's a collaborative effort to establish better standards and practices for antibody development, validation, and use.  It's a long road, but it's a necessary one.  Um, you know,  it's not just about the antibodies themselves, but also about how we report their use and how we share data. It's a bit of a snowball effect.

Sarah:  It sounds like a massive undertaking, but essential for the reliability of scientific research.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  It's really eye-opening.

It sounds like a massive undertaking, but essential for the reliability of scientific research.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  It's really eye-opening.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: So, Joe, all this talk about recombinant antibodies… it’s fascinating, but honestly, a little overwhelming.  Can you break down the key difference between them and the older methods, in plain English?  No fancy analogies, please!

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  The core difference boils down to *how* they're made.  Older methods often used immune cells, essentially harvesting antibodies from animals.  This process is… variable.  Each batch of antibodies might be slightly different, leading to inconsistencies in research.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don't use precise measurements, you won't get the same result every time.

Sarah: Okay, I get that.  So, recombinant antibodies are more… standardized?

Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies are made using genetically engineered cells. You program these cells to produce a *specific* antibody.  It's like having a precise recipe,  ensuring every batch is identical. This drastically improves reproducibility, you know, the ability to get the same results repeatedly.

Sarah:  So, if I understand correctly, the older methods are like using a hand-me-down recipe – you never know what you’ll get, whereas recombinant is like using a precise, modern recipe.  Is that fair?

Joe:  That's a decent analogy, actually.  It highlights the key difference in consistency.  With recombinant antibodies, you have far greater control over the production process, leading to higher quality and reliability.

Sarah:  And that's why the scientific community is pushing for this shift, right?  To improve the reliability of research?

Joe:  Precisely.  Inconsistency in antibodies has been a major hurdle in scientific reproducibility.  Using recombinant antibodies helps address this problem directly.  It's not a magical solution, mind you – researchers still need to validate their antibodies, but it significantly reduces one major source of variability.  It's a huge step forward.

Sarah:  It sounds like a massive undertaking, though, to switch over completely.  I mean, are all manufacturers on board with this?

Joe: Not yet, no.  It's a gradual shift. There's a significant cost associated with changing production methods, and some manufacturers are slower to adapt than others.  But the trend is definitely towards recombinant antibodies.  The benefits in terms of reliability and reproducibility are becoming increasingly clear.  And, as you mentioned earlier, funders are also incentivizing this change, which definitely helps speed up adoption.

Sarah: So, there’s still a long way to go, but the future looks brighter for consistent, reliable antibody research.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It makes a lot more sense now.

So, there’s still a long way to go, but the future looks brighter for consistent, reliable antibody research.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It makes a lot more sense now.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: So, Joe, you mentioned several ways to validate antibodies.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation...  That sounds like a lot.  Could you maybe walk me through each one a bit more simply?  Um, I’m still a little fuzzy on the specifics.

Joe: Sure, happy to.  Let's start with immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  Basically, you're using an antibody to label specific cells in a tissue sample.  Think of it like… well, okay, maybe a tiny paintbrush.  The antibody is the brush, and it only paints cells that have a particular protein on their surface.  If the protein's there, the antibody sticks, and you see a signal, usually a color change.  If not, nothing happens.  It's a pretty visual method.

Sarah: Okay, so you're literally seeing if the antibody binds to the target protein in a sample of cells.  Simple enough. What about Western blotting?

Joe: Right. Western blotting is different.  Here, you're looking at a mixture of proteins, separated by size.  Imagine it like a race; each protein runs at a speed based on its size.  You then use your antibody to specifically detect one protein in that mixture.  If it binds, you see a band at a specific location on your gel, corresponding to the protein's molecular weight.  It tells you if your antibody is binding to a protein of the expected size.

Sarah: So, IHC is for cells in tissue, and Western blotting is for a mixture of proteins separated by size.  Got it.  And what about immunoprecipitation?  That one sounds a bit more complicated.

Joe:  It is a bit more involved.  With immunoprecipitation, you use an antibody attached to a tiny bead.  Think of it like a magnet; the antibody, attached to the bead, "catches" the specific protein you're interested in from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can separate that protein and further analyze it, maybe using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  It's a more powerful technique to isolate and verify your target protein.

Sarah:  So, essentially, each method offers a different way to confirm the antibody is doing what it's supposed to do – binding to its intended target.  It’s all about confirming specificity and reliability.  That's why you need multiple validation steps, right?

Joe: Exactly.  Using multiple methods helps you build confidence.  One method might miss something, but by combining them, you increase the likelihood of getting a reliable result. It's all about minimizing those false positives and negatives. You know, ensuring the antibody actually works as intended is crucial for reliable research.

Sarah:  That makes a lot more sense now, Joe.  Thanks for breaking it down. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but your explanations really helped.  So,  all these validation steps are essential before using an antibody in a real experiment, right?

Joe: Absolutely.  You wouldn't want to build a whole experiment on an unreliable antibody, that could lead to inaccurate results and wasted time and resources.  Getting this right is fundamental to good research.

Sarah:  Completely agree. This has been incredibly helpful, Joe.  I feel like I have a much clearer understanding of antibody validation now.

Joe:  Great! I'm glad I could help.

Sarah: Thanks again for clarifying all of that, Joe. It’s been really insightful.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific studies.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I'm familiar with the frustration! I've heard whispers, you know, about the reproducibility crisis in science, and I've always wondered how much of that stemmed from issues like this.  So, what's the core problem with these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Um, well, the core problem is that many commercially available antibodies, the ones scientists use to, ah, identify and measure specific proteins in cells, just don't work as advertised. They either don't bind to the target protein properly, or worse, they bind to lots of other things, giving you completely inaccurate results.  Think of it like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach with a magnet that also attracts pebbles and seashells – you're not going to get a very accurate count of sand grains.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, so it's a specificity and selectivity issue.  They're not precise enough.  But how widespread is this problem?  Is this just a few bad apples, or is it a significant issue affecting a lot of research?
[INFO] Joe: It's a huge issue, Sarah.  One study we're discussing today highlights this perfectly.  A researcher, Carl Laflamme, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He looked at sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein. Only *three* actually worked as intended.  And get this – fifteen papers used an antibody that didn't even bind to the right protein!  Those papers were cited over 3,000 times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Three thousand citations based on faulty data. That's... staggering.  So, what are the consequences of using these unreliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Well, it's a massive waste of time and resources, for starters.  Researchers spend months, sometimes years, pursuing research based on faulty data. It also contributes to the reproducibility crisis, making it harder to verify results and slowing down scientific progress.  Think about the implications for drug development – if your initial findings are based on flawed data from unreliable antibodies, your entire drug development pathway could be wrong.
[INFO] Sarah: That's terrifying.  So, what's being done to address this? Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: There is hope! There are several initiatives springing up.  One is called iCharOS, which aims to rigorously test every commercially available antibody for human proteins.  It's a huge undertaking, but it's a crucial step towards establishing a more reliable database of antibodies.  There's also a push to improve antibody production, make it easier for researchers to find well-characterized antibodies, and of course, to encourage better practices in selecting and using them.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a much-needed overhaul.  It's a bit daunting, but hopefully, these initiatives can make a real difference and help restore some confidence in the reliability of research.  This has been a really eye-opening discussion, Joe. Thanks for shedding light on this important issue.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a critical issue, and hopefully, bringing it to light will help spur further change.  And that’s all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time!
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, we were talking about the YCharOS initiative and the huge problem of unreliable antibodies in research.  It's... it's a bigger deal than most people realize.  We're talking millions of antibody products, many of which simply don't perform as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Right. And that's terrifying, considering how much research relies on these things.  I mean, a faulty antibody could completely derail a study, right?  And it's not just one or two, it's, what, two-thirds failing in some studies? That’s a staggering number.  But what exactly *is* the problem?  Is it just poor manufacturing?
[INFO] Joe: **  It's multifaceted.  Part of it is manufacturing, certainly.  Quality control can be inconsistent across suppliers. But a bigger issue is the inherent complexity of antibody-antigen interactions.  An antibody's specificity – its ability to bind *only* to its intended target – is affected by many factors.  The concentration of the target protein in the sample, the presence of other proteins that might interfere, even the specific method used to detect the binding – all these things influence the results.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's not just a simple "this antibody binds to this protein" scenario?  It's more nuanced than that.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  Think of it like this –  (pause) Okay, maybe one analogy:  imagine trying to fit a key into a lock.  A well-made antibody is like a precisely crafted key that fits only one specific lock (the target protein). But if the lock is damaged, or if there's dirt in the keyhole, or if you're using the wrong kind of key, it might not work as expected.  That's a simplification, of course, but it illustrates the point.  The interaction is incredibly sensitive to its environment.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, YCharOS is essentially trying to standardize the testing process, right?  Making sure that, you know, the "key" actually fits the "lock" under various controlled conditions.  But how do they do that?  It's not like they can test every single application of every antibody.
[INFO] Joe: **  They focus on a standardized test, comparing the antibody's performance in a cell line expressing the target protein to its performance in a knockout cell line lacking the protein.  This helps isolate the antibody's specificity.  It's not a complete solution, because, as you pointed out, the real-world application can be vastly different, but it's a significant step towards improving reliability. They're essentially creating a baseline – a minimum standard of performance.
[INFO] Sarah: **  And the collaboration with antibody manufacturers is key, isn't it?  Getting them on board to participate in the testing and to act on the findings. That's a huge achievement.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  Without that cooperation, the impact would be severely limited.  It shows a real commitment to improving the quality of research tools.  It's a collaborative effort to address a systemic problem.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's not a perfect solution, but it's a crucial step forward.  It highlights the need for transparency and rigorous validation in scientific research – something that, frankly, is often overlooked.  This whole situation really underscores the importance of critical evaluation of reagents.
[INFO] Joe: ** Precisely.  And the work of groups like YCharOS and OMAPs –  they're vital for ensuring the reliability of the foundation upon which so much research is built.  It's a continuous process, though.  There's always more work to be done.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we were talking about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  This whole RRID system... it sounds incredibly important, but can you break it down for someone who's not a scientist?
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  Imagine you're following a recipe, right?  You need specific ingredients.  Antibodies are like those ingredients in scientific research.  RRIDs are basically unique identifiers – like product codes – for these antibodies.  Before RRIDs,  many researchers cited antibodies without a reliable way to identify the *exact* batch used in a study.  A company might discontinue a product, or the same code might be used for different products.  RRIDs prevent that ambiguity.  They're persistent identifiers, so even if a company changes something, the RRID remains linked to the specific antibody used. It's a crucial step towards reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like a permanent, universal barcode for antibodies. That makes sense. But even if you *can* find the antibody, how do you know it's actually doing what it's supposed to be doing?  This article mentions CiteAb...
[INFO] Joe: Right.  CiteAb is a search engine, specifically for antibodies.  It helps researchers find antibodies based on citations – how often they've been used in published papers.  That's a *hint* that they might be reliable, because they've been used successfully (at least seemingly) by other researchers. But it's not foolproof.  They also try to include validation data where available, which is even better.  You know,  showing that an antibody specifically targets the intended protein and nothing else is crucial.
[INFO] Sarah: So, more citations = potentially better, but not guaranteed?  It seems like there's still a huge problem with validation.  The article mentioned this "knock-out validation"... what's that?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's not guaranteed at all.  Knock-out validation is a rigorous method. You essentially remove the target protein from a cell or organism and then see if the antibody still detects something. If it doesn't detect anything, it's a strong indication that the antibody is specific to that target protein. It's the gold standard, but as the article points out, less than 5% of antibodies have this level of validation.  It's a very resource-intensive process.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's... disheartening.  So, what's the solution?  It sounds like a huge systemic problem.
[INFO] Joe: It is a systemic problem.  That's why initiatives like OGA – Only Good Antibodies – are so important.  They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, publishers – everyone involved – to try and improve things.  It's a collaborative effort to establish better standards and practices for antibody development, validation, and use.  It's a long road, but it's a necessary one.  Um, you know,  it's not just about the antibodies themselves, but also about how we report their use and how we share data. It's a bit of a snowball effect.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking, but essential for the reliability of scientific research.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  It's really eye-opening.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, all this talk about recombinant antibodies… it’s fascinating, but honestly, a little overwhelming.  Can you break down the key difference between them and the older methods, in plain English?  No fancy analogies, please!
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  The core difference boils down to *how* they're made.  Older methods often used immune cells, essentially harvesting antibodies from animals.  This process is… variable.  Each batch of antibodies might be slightly different, leading to inconsistencies in research.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don't use precise measurements, you won't get the same result every time.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, I get that.  So, recombinant antibodies are more… standardized?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies are made using genetically engineered cells. You program these cells to produce a *specific* antibody.  It's like having a precise recipe,  ensuring every batch is identical. This drastically improves reproducibility, you know, the ability to get the same results repeatedly.
[INFO] Sarah: So, if I understand correctly, the older methods are like using a hand-me-down recipe – you never know what you’ll get, whereas recombinant is like using a precise, modern recipe.  Is that fair?
[INFO] Joe: That's a decent analogy, actually.  It highlights the key difference in consistency.  With recombinant antibodies, you have far greater control over the production process, leading to higher quality and reliability.
[INFO] Sarah: And that's why the scientific community is pushing for this shift, right?  To improve the reliability of research?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  Inconsistency in antibodies has been a major hurdle in scientific reproducibility.  Using recombinant antibodies helps address this problem directly.  It's not a magical solution, mind you – researchers still need to validate their antibodies, but it significantly reduces one major source of variability.  It's a huge step forward.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking, though, to switch over completely.  I mean, are all manufacturers on board with this?
[INFO] Joe: Not yet, no.  It's a gradual shift. There's a significant cost associated with changing production methods, and some manufacturers are slower to adapt than others.  But the trend is definitely towards recombinant antibodies.  The benefits in terms of reliability and reproducibility are becoming increasingly clear.  And, as you mentioned earlier, funders are also incentivizing this change, which definitely helps speed up adoption.
[INFO] Sarah: So, there’s still a long way to go, but the future looks brighter for consistent, reliable antibody research.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It makes a lot more sense now.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you mentioned several ways to validate antibodies.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation...  That sounds like a lot.  Could you maybe walk me through each one a bit more simply?  Um, I’m still a little fuzzy on the specifics.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a little frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, I'm familiar with the frustrations!  I’ve heard whispers about the reproducibility crisis in science, and I suspect unreliable antibodies play a big role.  Can you give us a concrete example?

Joe: Absolutely.  Um, let's talk about Carl Laflamme's work. He was trying to study a protein, you know, encoded by a gene called C9ORF72. This gene's linked to motor neuron disease, ALS.  The problem?  Nobody could quite agree where this protein was located *within* the cell.  There was a huge amount of conflicting data in the literature.

Sarah:  So, conflicting results...sounds like a classic case of something going wrong.  Was it a problem with the experimental design, or something else?

Joe:  Well, Laflamme suspected the antibodies themselves might be the issue.  Antibodies are, you know, these molecules used to detect specific proteins in cells.  They're supposed to bind *only* to the target protein, but often they don't. They might bind to other things too – causing inaccurate results.  So, Laflamme and his team tested sixteen commercially available antibodies that were *supposed* to bind to this C9ORF72 protein.

Sarah: Sixteen? That’s a lot!  And what did they find?

Joe:  Only three actually worked properly!  Meaning they bound specifically to the target protein and nothing else.  Incredibly, fifteen of the papers describing experiments using antibodies that didn't work properly...had been cited over 3,000 times!

Sarah:  Wow.  That’s… staggering.  Three thousand citations based on flawed research?  That really highlights the scale of the problem, doesn't it?  So, is this a common issue?

Joe:  Unfortunately, yes. It's a huge problem.  Scientists have known for a long time that many commercial antibodies don't perform as advertised.  They lack specificity or selectivity, or both. This leads to wasted time, resources, and, as you said, contributes to the reproducibility crisis. It's really slowing down scientific progress and drug development.

Sarah:  So, what's being done to address this?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies producing these antibodies?

Joe: It's more than that. There are several initiatives.  One example is Laflamme's collaboration with Aled Edwards. They started a project called Icarus – Antibody Characterization through Open Science – aiming to characterize every commercially available antibody for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a step towards more reliable research.

Sarah: That sounds like a monumental task! I imagine it requires a significant amount of funding and collaboration.  Are funding agencies involved?

Joe: Absolutely. Funding agencies, antibody vendors, even scientific publishers are all starting to get involved.  It's a huge collaborative effort to try and fix what's been a long-standing problem.  It's a long shot, but, uh, there's a growing sense of urgency to improve the situation.  It's hard to imagine a sudden, complete fix, but there's definitely hope for improvement.

Sarah:  It's certainly encouraging to hear that so many groups are working on it.  Thanks for shedding light on this important, and somewhat hidden, issue, Joe.  This has been really eye-opening.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe:  So, Sarah, you’ve outlined some really interesting initiatives tackling the antibody validation problem.  YCharOS, for example, is impressive in its scale and collaborative approach.  Their methodology – comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – is straightforward, yet powerful.  It directly addresses the issue of specificity and selectivity.  They're essentially creating a gold standard for a subset of antibodies.

Sarah: Right, it's a huge undertaking. But it makes me wonder, how robust is this "knock-out cell line" method?  I mean, are there potential limitations?  Could there be other factors influencing the results beyond the simple presence or absence of the target protein?

Joe:  That's a very good point, Sarah.  You're right to be critical.  There could be off-target effects, or the knock-out might indirectly affect other pathways that influence the antibody's binding.  It's not a perfect system,  um... no method is truly perfect.  It's about minimizing these confounding factors through rigorous experimental design and controls, which, to their credit, YCharOS seems to be doing.  The strength lies in the large-scale comparison and the collaborative aspect, allowing for broader validation and identification of problems.

Sarah:  So, the scale helps to compensate for the limitations of the individual method.  That's interesting. You mentioned other initiatives, like OMAPs. How does their approach differ, and what are the trade-offs?

Joe: OMAPs takes a different tack.  Instead of focusing on a single, standardized test across many antibodies, they focus on validating antibodies within a specific application – multiplex imaging – but across different contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging techniques.  It's a trade-off.  YCharOS aims for broad applicability within a controlled setting, while OMAPs prioritizes validation within a specific application but across a broader range of biological conditions.  One isn't necessarily "better" than the other; they address different aspects of the problem.

Sarah: So, it's almost like a division of labor. YCharOS provides a baseline of validation, and then OMAPs builds upon that by testing in more realistic settings.  It's not about one being superior; it’s about complementary approaches.

Joe: Exactly!  And both approaches highlight the crucial need for community involvement and collaboration.  The sheer number of antibodies and their diverse applications make it impossible for any single entity to validate everything.  These initiatives demonstrate a shift towards a more open, shared responsibility in ensuring the reliability of research tools.  It's a really positive development, you know,  for the whole field.

Sarah:  It certainly is.  It’s encouraging to see this kind of collaborative effort addressing a problem that has clearly hampered research for a long time.  It really highlights the importance of transparency and open science in ensuring the reproducibility of scientific findings.  Thanks, Joe, for breaking that down for us. This has been incredibly helpful.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

Joe:  Yeah, it's a real problem.  Um, basically, there's a few key issues.  First, the labeling is inconsistent.  You know, companies use their own catalog numbers, which can change or disappear.  So, even if you find a paper that used a specific antibody, you might not be able to track it down easily.  That's where RRIDs, or Research Resource Identifiers, come in – they're meant to create a permanent, unique identifier for each antibody.

Sarah:  So RRIDs are like a permanent, universal product code for antibodies?  That makes sense.  But even if you *can* find the antibody, how do you know it's actually *good*?  I mean, how do you know it's going to work as expected in your experiment?

Joe:  Right. That's the bigger challenge.  There's no single, universally accepted standard for validating an antibody. Some methods are better than others, of course,  but the gold standard – knockout validation – is rarely done.  Plus, an antibody might work perfectly in one context, but not another – it depends on the species you're studying, the specific protein target, the technique you're using... it's incredibly complex.

Sarah: So, essentially, even with a perfect identifier, there's still a huge amount of uncertainty about the antibody's reliability?  That's pretty daunting for researchers.

Joe: Exactly.  It's a bit like searching for a specific tool in a poorly organized toolbox – you might find the tool, but you don't know if it's sharp, if it's the right size, or even if it's the right tool for the job.  And, you know,  a lot of researchers are relying on antibodies that haven't been rigorously validated.  That obviously impacts the reproducibility of scientific results.

Sarah:  And that's where initiatives like CiteAb and Only Good Antibodies (OGA) come in, right?  They're trying to improve this situation by creating databases and fostering collaboration.

Joe:  Precisely.  CiteAb focuses on compiling information on antibody citations and validations, providing a searchable database.  OGA, on the other hand, is a more collaborative effort, bringing together researchers, manufacturers, and funders to address the problem holistically.  They're working to establish better standards and best practices for antibody validation and use.  It’s a multi-pronged approach.

Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task.  But it’s encouraging to hear that so many people are working on this.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It’s much clearer now.

**Previous Context**:
It sounds like a monumental task.  But it’s encouraging to hear that so many people are working on this.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It’s much clearer now.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Wow, that's a lot of information! So, to summarize, the main problem is the inconsistency of antibodies, right?  Different batches can perform differently, making research less reliable.  And the solution seems to be a multi-pronged approach: better validation, shifting to recombinant antibodies, and changing researcher behavior. Is that a fair summary?

Joe:  Yeah, pretty much. The core issue is reproducibility.  You know,  getting the same results repeatedly is crucial in science.  Inconsistent antibodies are a major hurdle to that.  And you're right, it's not just one thing.  We need better validation methods – ways to rigorously test if an antibody actually works as intended.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is a big part of the solution, because their production process is much more standardized, leading to greater consistency between batches.  But, um... changing researcher behavior is proving to be the toughest nut to crack.

Sarah:  So, let's talk about these recombinant antibodies.  You mentioned they're made in genetically engineered cells. Can you explain that a little more?  I understand the "genetically engineered" part, but how does that actually lead to more consistent antibodies?

Joe:  Okay, so with traditional methods, you're essentially harvesting antibodies from an animal's immune system. That's a pretty complex biological process, and the resulting antibodies can vary quite a bit.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in a controlled environment.  We engineer cells to produce a specific antibody sequence,  you know, a precise blueprint.  This eliminates a lot of the variability inherent in the older methods.  It's like comparing baking a cake from scratch using random ingredients versus following a precise recipe – the recipe gives you much more consistent results.

Sarah:  That's a helpful analogy. So, it's not just about the source of the antibody, it's about the *method* of production. The control over the process is key.

Joe: Exactly. The control over the production process is the key to consistency.  Think of it like this:  you wouldn't expect two batches of cars made on completely different assembly lines, with different workers and varying quality control, to be identical.  Recombinant antibody production is more like a highly automated assembly line, producing a uniform product.

Sarah:  Makes sense.  But you mentioned changing researcher behavior is a challenge.  Why is that so difficult?  Are researchers resistant to change?

Joe:  Partly, yes. Some researchers have been using certain antibodies for years, and they're comfortable with them, even if there's evidence that they're not completely reliable.  There's also inertia, you know?  It takes time and effort to switch to new methods and validate new antibodies. It's not just about convenience, there's also a potential for setbacks in ongoing research if they switch antibodies.  Plus, there's a lack of incentives sometimes;  rewarding researchers for adopting best practices is a crucial step in overcoming this resistance.

Sarah: So, it's a combination of habit, effort, and a lack of clear incentives.  It sounds like a significant cultural shift needs to happen within the scientific community.

Joe: Absolutely.  It's a complex problem with no easy solutions, but the progress being made – the collaborative efforts, the development of new technologies and resources – is encouraging.  It's a long-term project, but I'm optimistic that we're moving in the right direction.

And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 (Sound of a gentle cough)

Sarah: So, Joe, you were just explaining the different ways researchers validate antibodies.  Um… it sounds… complicated.  Can you maybe break it down a bit more for our listeners?  Like, what's the *point* of all these different methods?

Joe:  Right, so the point is to make sure the antibody actually does what it's supposed to do.  You know,  it's like…  we're trying to identify a specific protein in a cell, a bit like finding a specific needle in a very, very large haystack.  We need to be absolutely certain that our "magnet" (the antibody) is only picking up the right needle and not others.

Sarah: Okay, so we’re not using magnets here, right?  Just clarifying.

Joe: (Chuckles) No magnets, Sarah.  Just highly specific proteins.  So, we use these different techniques – immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation – to verify the antibody's specificity.  Immunohistochemistry, for example, lets us see *where* the protein is located within a cell or tissue sample.  It's like a visual confirmation.

Sarah:  So, it's kind of like… highlighting the protein with a fluorescent marker? Is that a fair, albeit simplified analogy?

Joe:  It's a reasonable analogy, although it's more about the antibody binding to the protein, which then allows us to detect it using various detection methods.  The highlighting is a consequence of that binding.  Western blotting, on the other hand,  separates proteins by size and then shows us if the antibody binds to a protein of the expected size.  It's a different type of confirmation, focusing on the protein's molecular weight.

Sarah:  And immunoprecipitation?  That sounds… intense.

Joe:  It is a bit more involved.  We use the antibody to literally fish out the specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it like using a net to catch a specific fish from a large pond.  Then, we use mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the "fish" we've caught.

Sarah: So, each method provides a different kind of validation, right?  It's not just one and done.

Joe: Exactly.  Using multiple methods provides a much higher level of confidence.  It's about cross-validation. If all three methods point to the same conclusion, we have strong evidence that our antibody is working correctly.  Otherwise, we might need to go back to the drawing board and try a different antibody or refine our methods.  It's a painstaking process, but it’s crucial for reliable results.  You know,  the reliability of these methods underpins the whole field.

Sarah:  So, it's like a quality control process, but on a microscopic level.  That’s… pretty amazing, actually.  And also, it sounds like a lot of work.

Joe:  It is a lot of work, and it highlights the importance of rigorous validation in scientific research.  Getting reliable results takes time and effort.  But it's essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of scientific findings.

Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for clearing that up, Joe.  I think our listeners will appreciate the detailed explanation.

Joe: You're welcome, Sarah.  I hope it was clear enough.

Sarah: It was!

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a little frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I'm familiar with the frustrations!  I’ve heard whispers about the reproducibility crisis in science, and I suspect unreliable antibodies play a big role.  Can you give us a concrete example?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  Um, let's talk about Carl Laflamme's work. He was trying to study a protein, you know, encoded by a gene called C9ORF72. This gene's linked to motor neuron disease, ALS.  The problem?  Nobody could quite agree where this protein was located *within* the cell.  There was a huge amount of conflicting data in the literature.
[INFO] Sarah: So, conflicting results...sounds like a classic case of something going wrong.  Was it a problem with the experimental design, or something else?
[INFO] Joe: Well, Laflamme suspected the antibodies themselves might be the issue.  Antibodies are, you know, these molecules used to detect specific proteins in cells.  They're supposed to bind *only* to the target protein, but often they don't. They might bind to other things too – causing inaccurate results.  So, Laflamme and his team tested sixteen commercially available antibodies that were *supposed* to bind to this C9ORF72 protein.
[INFO] Sarah: Sixteen? That’s a lot!  And what did they find?
[INFO] Joe: Only three actually worked properly!  Meaning they bound specifically to the target protein and nothing else.  Incredibly, fifteen of the papers describing experiments using antibodies that didn't work properly...had been cited over 3,000 times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow.  That’s… staggering.  Three thousand citations based on flawed research?  That really highlights the scale of the problem, doesn't it?  So, is this a common issue?
[INFO] Joe: Unfortunately, yes. It's a huge problem.  Scientists have known for a long time that many commercial antibodies don't perform as advertised.  They lack specificity or selectivity, or both. This leads to wasted time, resources, and, as you said, contributes to the reproducibility crisis. It's really slowing down scientific progress and drug development.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to address this?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies producing these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: It's more than that. There are several initiatives.  One example is Laflamme's collaboration with Aled Edwards. They started a project called Icarus – Antibody Characterization through Open Science – aiming to characterize every commercially available antibody for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's a step towards more reliable research.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a monumental task! I imagine it requires a significant amount of funding and collaboration.  Are funding agencies involved?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. Funding agencies, antibody vendors, even scientific publishers are all starting to get involved.  It's a huge collaborative effort to try and fix what's been a long-standing problem.  It's a long shot, but, uh, there's a growing sense of urgency to improve the situation.  It's hard to imagine a sudden, complete fix, but there's definitely hope for improvement.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, you’ve outlined some really interesting initiatives tackling the antibody validation problem.  YCharOS, for example, is impressive in its scale and collaborative approach.  Their methodology – comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – is straightforward, yet powerful.  It directly addresses the issue of specificity and selectivity.  They're essentially creating a gold standard for a subset of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, it's a huge undertaking. But it makes me wonder, how robust is this "knock-out cell line" method?  I mean, are there potential limitations?  Could there be other factors influencing the results beyond the simple presence or absence of the target protein?
[INFO] Joe: That's a very good point, Sarah.  You're right to be critical.  There could be off-target effects, or the knock-out might indirectly affect other pathways that influence the antibody's binding.  It's not a perfect system,  um... no method is truly perfect.  It's about minimizing these confounding factors through rigorous experimental design and controls, which, to their credit, YCharOS seems to be doing.  The strength lies in the large-scale comparison and the collaborative aspect, allowing for broader validation and identification of problems.
[INFO] Sarah: So, the scale helps to compensate for the limitations of the individual method.  That's interesting. You mentioned other initiatives, like OMAPs. How does their approach differ, and what are the trade-offs?
[INFO] Joe: OMAPs takes a different tack.  Instead of focusing on a single, standardized test across many antibodies, they focus on validating antibodies within a specific application – multiplex imaging – but across different contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging techniques.  It's a trade-off.  YCharOS aims for broad applicability within a controlled setting, while OMAPs prioritizes validation within a specific application but across a broader range of biological conditions.  One isn't necessarily "better" than the other; they address different aspects of the problem.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's almost like a division of labor. YCharOS provides a baseline of validation, and then OMAPs builds upon that by testing in more realistic settings.  It's not about one being superior; it’s about complementary approaches.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  And both approaches highlight the crucial need for community involvement and collaboration.  The sheer number of antibodies and their diverse applications make it impossible for any single entity to validate everything.  These initiatives demonstrate a shift towards a more open, shared responsibility in ensuring the reliability of research tools.  It's a really positive development, you know,  for the whole field.
[INFO] Sarah: It certainly is.  It’s encouraging to see this kind of collaborative effort addressing a problem that has clearly hampered research for a long time.  It really highlights the importance of transparency and open science in ensuring the reproducibility of scientific findings.  Thanks, Joe, for breaking that down for us. This has been incredibly helpful.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about the challenges of finding reliable antibodies and the initiatives trying to solve this.  It sounds like a huge mess!  Can you walk me through, simply, what makes finding the *right* antibody so difficult?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a real problem.  Um, basically, there's a few key issues.  First, the labeling is inconsistent.  You know, companies use their own catalog numbers, which can change or disappear.  So, even if you find a paper that used a specific antibody, you might not be able to track it down easily.  That's where RRIDs, or Research Resource Identifiers, come in – they're meant to create a permanent, unique identifier for each antibody.
[INFO] Sarah: So RRIDs are like a permanent, universal product code for antibodies?  That makes sense.  But even if you *can* find the antibody, how do you know it's actually *good*?  I mean, how do you know it's going to work as expected in your experiment?
[INFO] Joe: Right. That's the bigger challenge.  There's no single, universally accepted standard for validating an antibody. Some methods are better than others, of course,  but the gold standard – knockout validation – is rarely done.  Plus, an antibody might work perfectly in one context, but not another – it depends on the species you're studying, the specific protein target, the technique you're using... it's incredibly complex.
[INFO] Sarah: So, essentially, even with a perfect identifier, there's still a huge amount of uncertainty about the antibody's reliability?  That's pretty daunting for researchers.
[INFO] Sarah: And that's where initiatives like CiteAb and Only Good Antibodies (OGA) come in, right?  They're trying to improve this situation by creating databases and fostering collaboration.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  CiteAb focuses on compiling information on antibody citations and validations, providing a searchable database.  OGA, on the other hand, is a more collaborative effort, bringing together researchers, manufacturers, and funders to address the problem holistically.  They're working to establish better standards and best practices for antibody validation and use.  It’s a multi-pronged approach.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task.  But it’s encouraging to hear that so many people are working on this.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It’s much clearer now.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a bit like searching for a specific tool in a poorly organized toolbox – you might find the tool, but you don't know if it's sharp, if it's the right size, or even if it's the right tool for the job.  And, you know,  a lot of researchers are relying on antibodies that haven't been rigorously validated.  That obviously impacts the reproducibility of scientific results.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a lot of information! So, to summarize, the main problem is the inconsistency of antibodies, right?  Different batches can perform differently, making research less reliable.  And the solution seems to be a multi-pronged approach: better validation, shifting to recombinant antibodies, and changing researcher behavior. Is that a fair summary?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, pretty much. The core issue is reproducibility.  You know,  getting the same results repeatedly is crucial in science.  Inconsistent antibodies are a major hurdle to that.  And you're right, it's not just one thing.  We need better validation methods – ways to rigorously test if an antibody actually works as intended.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is a big part of the solution, because their production process is much more standardized, leading to greater consistency between batches.  But, um... changing researcher behavior is proving to be the toughest nut to crack.
[INFO] Sarah: So, let's talk about these recombinant antibodies.  You mentioned they're made in genetically engineered cells. Can you explain that a little more?  I understand the "genetically engineered" part, but how does that actually lead to more consistent antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Okay, so with traditional methods, you're essentially harvesting antibodies from an animal's immune system. That's a pretty complex biological process, and the resulting antibodies can vary quite a bit.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in a controlled environment.  We engineer cells to produce a specific antibody sequence,  you know, a precise blueprint.  This eliminates a lot of the variability inherent in the older methods.  It's like comparing baking a cake from scratch using random ingredients versus following a precise recipe – the recipe gives you much more consistent results.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a helpful analogy. So, it's not just about the source of the antibody, it's about the *method* of production. The control over the process is key.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. The control over the production process is the key to consistency.  Think of it like this:  you wouldn't expect two batches of cars made on completely different assembly lines, with different workers and varying quality control, to be identical.  Recombinant antibody production is more like a highly automated assembly line, producing a uniform product.
[INFO] Sarah: Makes sense.  But you mentioned changing researcher behavior is a challenge.  Why is that so difficult?  Are researchers resistant to change?
[INFO] Joe: Partly, yes. Some researchers have been using certain antibodies for years, and they're comfortable with them, even if there's evidence that they're not completely reliable.  There's also inertia, you know?  It takes time and effort to switch to new methods and validate new antibodies. It's not just about convenience, there's also a potential for setbacks in ongoing research if they switch antibodies.  Plus, there's a lack of incentives sometimes;  rewarding researchers for adopting best practices is a crucial step in overcoming this resistance.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of habit, effort, and a lack of clear incentives.  It sounds like a significant cultural shift needs to happen within the scientific community.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a complex problem with no easy solutions, but the progress being made – the collaborative efforts, the development of new technologies and resources – is encouraging.  It's a long-term project, but I'm optimistic that we're moving in the right direction.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you were just explaining the different ways researchers validate antibodies.  Um… it sounds… complicated.  Can you maybe break it down a bit more for our listeners?  Like, what's the *point* of all these different methods?
[INFO] Joe: Right, so the point is to make sure the antibody actually does what it's supposed to do.  You know,  it's like…  we're trying to identify a specific protein in a cell, a bit like finding a specific needle in a very, very large haystack.  We need to be absolutely certain that our "magnet" (the antibody) is only picking up the right needle and not others.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so we’re not using magnets here, right?  Just clarifying.
[INFO] Joe: (Chuckles) No magnets, Sarah.  Just highly specific proteins.  So, we use these different techniques – immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation – to verify the antibody's specificity.  Immunohistochemistry, for example, lets us see *where* the protein is located within a cell or tissue sample.  It's like a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's kind of like… highlighting the protein with a fluorescent marker? Is that a fair, albeit simplified analogy?
[INFO] Joe: It's a reasonable analogy, although it's more about the antibody binding to the protein, which then allows us to detect it using various detection methods.  The highlighting is a consequence of that binding.  Western blotting, on the other hand,  separates proteins by size and then shows us if the antibody binds to a protein of the expected size.  It's a different type of confirmation, focusing on the protein's molecular weight.
[INFO] Sarah: And immunoprecipitation?  That sounds… intense.
[INFO] Joe: It is a bit more involved.  We use the antibody to literally fish out the specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it like using a net to catch a specific fish from a large pond.  Then, we use mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the "fish" we've caught.
[INFO] Sarah: So, each method provides a different kind of validation, right?  It's not just one and done.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Using multiple methods provides a much higher level of confidence.  It's about cross-validation. If all three methods point to the same conclusion, we have strong evidence that our antibody is working correctly.  Otherwise, we might need to go back to the drawing board and try a different antibody or refine our methods.  It's a painstaking process, but it’s crucial for reliable results.  You know,  the reliability of these methods underpins the whole field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like a quality control process, but on a microscopic level.  That’s… pretty amazing, actually.  And also, it sounds like a lot of work.
[INFO] Joe: It is a lot of work, and it highlights the importance of rigorous validation in scientific research.  Getting reliable results takes time and effort.  But it's essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of scientific findings.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for clearing that up, Joe.  I think our listeners will appreciate the detailed explanation.
[INFO] Joe: You're welcome, Sarah.  I hope it was clear enough.
[INFO] Sarah: It was!

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, I'm familiar with the frustration!  I've heard whispers about this reproducibility crisis, and how unreliable antibodies might play a role. But I don't really understand the technical details. Can you break it down for me?

Joe:  Sure, um… let's start with the basics.  Antibodies are, you know, these molecules our immune systems use to target foreign invaders—viruses, bacteria, that sort of thing.  Scientists use them in labs to, ah, identify and quantify specific proteins.  Think of them as really precise molecular tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies just… don't work as advertised.

Sarah:  Don't work?  Meaning...?

Joe:  Meaning they either don't bind to the intended protein at all, or they bind to lots of other proteins, too.  So you get false positives, false negatives… messy, unreliable data.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, was looking at a protein linked to motor neuron disease.  He found that out of sixteen commercially available antibodies *supposed* to target this specific protein, only three actually worked.  And none of those three were used in any of the previously published studies on this protein!

Sarah:  Wow. That's… alarming. So, those thousands of citations based on studies using the faulty antibodies are essentially… invalid?

Joe:  Potentially, yes.  It's a huge problem.  These faulty antibodies lead to wasted time, resources, and potentially, incorrect conclusions that slow down scientific progress.  It's contributed to what some people call a reproducibility crisis.  You spend months, maybe years, doing research, and then your results are questionable because of a faulty reagent.

Sarah:  It's like building a house on a shaky foundation. So, what's being done to fix this?

Joe:  Well, there are several initiatives springing up. One,  called iCharOS, aims to systematically test every commercially available antibody against every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it could create a much-needed database of reliable antibodies.  There are also efforts to improve the production of antibodies, making them more specific and reliable.  It’s a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah:  That sounds like a monumental task. I mean, it's almost like cleaning up years of accumulated errors, right?


Joe:  Exactly! It’s a huge undertaking, but hopefully, these efforts will lead to more reliable research and faster progress in fields like drug development.  It's a long road, but there's definitely a growing awareness of the problem and a concerted effort to solve it.  The hope is that, eventually, scientists can trust the reagents they use.

Sarah: That's definitely encouraging to hear. Thanks for shedding light on this crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of scientific research, Joe.  This has been a really enlightening discussion.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And to our listeners, thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore…

And none of those three were used in any of the previously published studies on this protein!"

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, we've been talking about the massive antibody market and the surprisingly high failure rate of commercially available antibodies.  YCharOS is a really interesting approach to tackling this problem, isn't it?

Sarah: Absolutely, Joe.  It's fascinating how they've managed to get so many antibody suppliers on board.  But I'm still a little unclear on their core methodology.  Could you explain how they actually *test* these antibodies?  They mention something about knock-out cell lines...

Joe: Right.  Essentially, they use a comparative approach.  They test the antibody's binding to a cell line that *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is *supposed* to bind to – at normal levels. Then, they compare that to its binding in a "knock-out" cell line.  This knock-out line has been genetically modified to *lack* that specific protein.

Sarah: Okay, so it's a control group, essentially.  If the antibody only binds strongly to the normal cell line and shows minimal binding to the knock-out, that suggests good specificity, right?  It's only binding where it's supposed to.

Joe: Exactly.  That's the core principle.  A strong signal in the normal cell line and a weak or absent signal in the knock-out indicates high specificity – the antibody is really only binding to its intended target.  A weak or absent signal in *both* cell lines suggests a problem with the antibody itself.  It might not be binding effectively at all.  Um...  and a strong signal in both suggests a lack of specificity; it's binding to something else too.

Sarah:  That makes sense.  So, they're essentially verifying the manufacturer's claims about the antibody's target and its binding affinity.  It's a pretty straightforward, yet powerful approach.  But you mentioned earlier that even with this rigorous testing, there are still limitations.

Joe: Yes, absolutely.  YCharOS focuses on a specific type of test in a controlled environment.  The context matters. How the antibody performs in their standardized test doesn't guarantee its performance in every possible research setting. Different cell types, tissues, or experimental protocols could all influence the results. Think of it like this – a car might pass all its safety tests in a controlled lab environment, but its performance on a bumpy, muddy road could be vastly different.  Though, I'd prefer to avoid analogies altogether. It's more accurate to say that the conditions of the test are specific.

Sarah:  Right, the context is crucial.  It sounds like YCharOS provides a valuable first step, a kind of quality control, but it's not a complete solution.  It highlights the complexity of antibody validation.  It's not just a simple "pass" or "fail."

Joe:  Precisely.  There's a lot of nuance involved.  And, you know, the sheer number of antibodies on the market makes complete validation a monumental task.  But initiatives like YCharOS are making a significant contribution to improving the reliability of research.

Sarah:  Absolutely.  It's a huge step forward in ensuring the integrity of scientific research.  And it's encouraging to see the level of collaboration between researchers and industry in this effort.  Thanks for explaining that, Joe.  It was much clearer than I expected!

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro Music fades out)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone!  Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies, with Joe here to shed some light on the challenges and solutions. Joe, thanks for joining us.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a fascinating, and frankly, sometimes frustrating area.  We’ve all been there, you know, spending weeks on an experiment only to find out your antibodies are… less than ideal.

**Sarah:** Absolutely!  So, let's start with the basics.  For our listeners who aren't scientists, can you explain what the problem with antibodies is in simple terms?

**Joe:** Sure.  The problem is basically this:  scientists rely heavily on antibodies to identify and study specific proteins in cells and tissues.  But many commercially available antibodies don't actually work as advertised. They might not bind to the target protein correctly, they might bind to other things too, or they might not even work at all. This makes research findings unreliable, difficult to reproduce, and sometimes, completely invalid.

**Sarah:** So, it's like buying a tool that's supposed to do one job, but it does something completely different, or nothing at all?

**Joe:**  That's... not a bad analogy, actually.  Though it's more nuanced than that.  It's not just about the tool being faulty; it's also about the lack of clear labeling and consistent identification.  Think of it like trying to find a specific screw in a hardware store with only a vague description.  You might find *something* that seems similar, but it might not fit.

**Sarah:**  Right.  So, how are researchers trying to solve this?  I read about these RRIDs…

**Joe:**  Yes, Research Resource Identifiers, or RRIDs.  Think of them as unique, permanent serial numbers for antibodies and other research materials.  Before RRIDs,  many antibodies were described vaguely in publications, making it nearly impossible to track down the exact same batch used in a particular experiment.  RRIDs provide a way to uniquely identify each antibody, making replication much easier.

**Sarah:**  So, it's like a universal product code for research materials?

**Joe:**  Precisely!  It helps researchers find the *exact* antibody used in a previous study, increasing the chances of replicating the results.  It's a crucial step towards improving reproducibility.

**Sarah:**  And what about the issue of actually finding *good* antibodies?  The article mentioned CiteAb…

**Joe:**  CiteAb is a search engine specifically designed for antibodies. It compiles data on antibody usage and citations, giving researchers a better idea of which antibodies are reliable based on how often they've been successfully used in published research.  They also try to include validation data when available, but that's a big challenge.

**Sarah:**  A big challenge?  Why?

**Joe:**  Well, validating an antibody rigorously is a complex and time-consuming process. There isn't one single gold standard for validation.  Different methods exist, and even "validated" antibodies might not perform well in every application.  It's a complex problem with no easy fixes.

**Sarah:**  So, it sounds like there’s a lot of work to be done.  It’s almost like a whole ecosystem needs to change, right? Researchers, manufacturers, journals…everyone?

**Joe:** Exactly.  That's where initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community come in. They're trying to bring all these stakeholders together—researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers—to collaboratively address this issue and improve the overall quality and reliability of antibodies in research.

**Sarah:** That sounds promising. It seems like a collective effort is essential to tackle such a widespread problem. Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really enlightening.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. It’s a complex issue, but hopefully, initiatives like RRIDs and OGA will make a real difference.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, you’ve laid out a pretty comprehensive picture of the antibody reproducibility crisis and the ongoing efforts to address it.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is, I think, the most significant development.  It's not just about *feeling* better; it's about eliminating a fundamental source of variability.  Traditional methods, using immune cells or hybridomas, inherently produce antibodies with batch-to-batch differences in their structure and, consequently, their performance.

Sarah: Right.  That’s what I found most striking.  The idea that the antibodies themselves weren't consistent – that's a huge problem, isn't it?  I mean, you're basing your entire research on something that might subtly change between experiments.  It makes it almost impossible to replicate results.

Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies, produced in genetically engineered cells, offer a solution to that. You're essentially programming the cells to produce a specific, defined antibody sequence.  This eliminates the inherent variability of the older methods.  Think of it like… well, forget analogies, it’s simpler to say this: with traditional methods, you're growing a field of slightly different plants, hoping they'll all be the same; with recombinant methods, you're cloning a specific plant, ensuring every plant is identical.

Sarah: Okay, that's a helpful way to put it, even if you tried to avoid the analogy.  So, if the problem is solved at the production stage, why is changing scientist behavior still such a big hurdle?

Joe:  Um, because habits are hard to break.  Many researchers have established workflows using older, less reliable antibodies.  They might be getting results, even if those results aren't perfectly reproducible.  There's a significant inertia there, a reluctance to change established practices, even if those practices are flawed.  And, frankly, validating a new antibody can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Sarah: So it’s not just about the cost of the new antibodies themselves, but the time and effort to re-validate everything? That makes perfect sense. It's a substantial investment for scientists.  And you mentioned initiatives like RRIDs and OGA… how do those fit into this picture?

Joe:  They're crucial for improving transparency and data sharing. RRIDs provide unique identifiers for antibodies, making it easier to track their use and verify their provenance.  OGA, on the other hand, is fostering a community around best practices, promoting the use of validated antibodies, and encouraging researchers to share their data. They're essentially building a framework to support this shift towards better reproducibility.

Sarah: So, it’s a multi-pronged approach.  You need the technological advancements in antibody production, coupled with initiatives that encourage adoption and provide the tools for better data management.  And, of course, you need scientists to actually change their habits.  It’s a complex problem.

Joe:  Precisely.  It's not a simple fix, but the progress made so far, particularly the shift towards recombinants, is undeniably significant.  The future looks brighter, especially with the younger generation of scientists actively engaging in these initiatives.  There's a real sense of community forming around this, and that’s encouraging.

 (Podcast intro music fades out)

**Sarah:** So, Joe, you were just saying how researchers validate these antibodies.  That sounded… complicated.  Let’s break it down for our listeners.  You mentioned three methods, right?

**Joe:** Yeah, three main ones.  Um, there's immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Immunohistochemistry, or IHC, is basically… well, it's like staining cells. You know, you have these cells, and you’re looking for a specific protein.  The antibody, if it works, will bind to that protein, and you can see it under a microscope.  It’s a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:** So, it's like… highlighting the protein?  Like, if the protein's there, the antibody acts as a highlighter, making it visible?

**Joe:**  You could think of it that way, yeah.  A helpful analogy, although it’s not a perfect one.  The important thing is that it shows you *where* the protein is located within the cell.

**Sarah:** Okay.  And what about Western blotting?

**Joe:**  Western blotting is different. It’s more about confirming the *size* and *presence* of the protein.  You run a sample through a gel, and the proteins separate based on their size. Then, you use the antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – a specific molecular weight, as we mentioned before.  If it does, you see a band on the blot – a visual indicator.

**Sarah:**  So, IHC shows location, Western blotting shows size and presence.  Got it.  And immunoprecipitation? That sounds the most… technical.

**Joe:**  It is a bit more involved.  Here, you use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it like fishing with a magnet – the antibody is the magnet, and the protein is the metal.  Once you've "fished" the protein, you can then use other techniques, like mass spectrometry, to confirm its identity.  It's a more precise method for identifying a specific protein within a complex sample.

**Sarah:**  So, it's like a more targeted approach to isolation and identification?

**Joe:** Exactly.  It's more powerful, but also more complex to perform.  Each method has its strengths and weaknesses.  Often, researchers use a combination of these techniques to get a more complete picture.

**Sarah:**  That makes a lot more sense now. So, it's not just one test, but rather a combination of tests to really confirm the antibody's effectiveness.  It's a pretty rigorous process.  I can see why you might feel frustrated with the level of validation needed sometimes.

**Joe:**  It is rigorous, and it can be frustrating.  But that rigor is essential for ensuring the reliability of scientific findings.  You know, ultimately, it's all about ensuring that the results are accurate and trustworthy.  And that's what keeps me going, even on the toughest days.

**Sarah:** That's a good point, Joe.  It's about the integrity of the science, and the impact that reliable findings can have.

**Joe:** Precisely. And the fact that we're making progress, even if slowly, is hugely motivating.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  Well, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking down these complex processes for us.

**Joe:**  My pleasure, Sarah.

**Sarah:**  So, before we wrap up, can you just reiterate why these validation methods are so important?

**Joe:** Of course.  These methods are crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of research using antibodies.  Incorrectly validated antibodies can lead to inaccurate results, potentially wasting time, resources, and even leading to flawed conclusions in research.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I'm familiar with the frustration!  I've heard whispers about this reproducibility crisis, and how unreliable antibodies might play a role. But I don't really understand the technical details. Can you break it down for me?
[INFO] Joe: Sure, um… let's start with the basics.  Antibodies are, you know, these molecules our immune systems use to target foreign invaders—viruses, bacteria, that sort of thing.  Scientists use them in labs to, ah, identify and quantify specific proteins.  Think of them as really precise molecular tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies just… don't work as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: Don't work?  Meaning...?
[INFO] Joe: Meaning they either don't bind to the intended protein at all, or they bind to lots of other proteins, too.  So you get false positives, false negatives… messy, unreliable data.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, was looking at a protein linked to motor neuron disease.  He found that out of sixteen commercially available antibodies *supposed* to target this specific protein, only three actually worked.  And none of those three were used in any of the previously published studies on this protein!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. That's… alarming. So, those thousands of citations based on studies using the faulty antibodies are essentially… invalid?
[INFO] Joe: Potentially, yes.  It's a huge problem.  These faulty antibodies lead to wasted time, resources, and potentially, incorrect conclusions that slow down scientific progress.  It's contributed to what some people call a reproducibility crisis.  You spend months, maybe years, doing research, and then your results are questionable because of a faulty reagent.
[INFO] Sarah: It's like building a house on a shaky foundation. So, what's being done to fix this?
[INFO] Joe: Well, there are several initiatives springing up. One,  called iCharOS, aims to systematically test every commercially available antibody against every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it could create a much-needed database of reliable antibodies.  There are also efforts to improve the production of antibodies, making them more specific and reliable.  It’s a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a monumental task. I mean, it's almost like cleaning up years of accumulated errors, right?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly! It’s a huge undertaking, but hopefully, these efforts will lead to more reliable research and faster progress in fields like drug development.  It's a long road, but there's definitely a growing awareness of the problem and a concerted effort to solve it.  The hope is that, eventually, scientists can trust the reagents they use.
[INFO] Sarah: That's definitely encouraging to hear. Thanks for shedding light on this crucial, and often overlooked, aspect of scientific research, Joe.  This has been a really enlightening discussion.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And to our listeners, thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore…
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, we've been talking about the massive antibody market and the surprisingly high failure rate of commercially available antibodies.  YCharOS is a really interesting approach to tackling this problem, isn't it?
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely, Joe.  It's fascinating how they've managed to get so many antibody suppliers on board.  But I'm still a little unclear on their core methodology.  Could you explain how they actually *test* these antibodies?  They mention something about knock-out cell lines...
[INFO] Joe: Right.  Essentially, they use a comparative approach.  They test the antibody's binding to a cell line that *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is *supposed* to bind to – at normal levels. Then, they compare that to its binding in a "knock-out" cell line.  This knock-out line has been genetically modified to *lack* that specific protein.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's a control group, essentially.  If the antibody only binds strongly to the normal cell line and shows minimal binding to the knock-out, that suggests good specificity, right?  It's only binding where it's supposed to.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  That's the core principle.  A strong signal in the normal cell line and a weak or absent signal in the knock-out indicates high specificity – the antibody is really only binding to its intended target.  A weak or absent signal in *both* cell lines suggests a problem with the antibody itself.  It might not be binding effectively at all.  Um...  and a strong signal in both suggests a lack of specificity; it's binding to something else too.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes sense.  So, they're essentially verifying the manufacturer's claims about the antibody's target and its binding affinity.  It's a pretty straightforward, yet powerful approach.  But you mentioned earlier that even with this rigorous testing, there are still limitations.
[INFO] Joe: Yes, absolutely.  YCharOS focuses on a specific type of test in a controlled environment.  The context matters. How the antibody performs in their standardized test doesn't guarantee its performance in every possible research setting. Different cell types, tissues, or experimental protocols could all influence the results. Think of it like this – a car might pass all its safety tests in a controlled lab environment, but its performance on a bumpy, muddy road could be vastly different.  Though, I'd prefer to avoid analogies altogether. It's more accurate to say that the conditions of the test are specific.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, the context is crucial.  It sounds like YCharOS provides a valuable first step, a kind of quality control, but it's not a complete solution.  It highlights the complexity of antibody validation.  It's not just a simple "pass" or "fail."
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  There's a lot of nuance involved.  And, you know, the sheer number of antibodies on the market makes complete validation a monumental task.  But initiatives like YCharOS are making a significant contribution to improving the reliability of research.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely.  It's a huge step forward in ensuring the integrity of scientific research.  And it's encouraging to see the level of collaboration between researchers and industry in this effort.  Thanks for explaining that, Joe.  It was much clearer than I expected!
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah. And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone!  Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies, with Joe here to shed some light on the challenges and solutions. Joe, thanks for joining us.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a fascinating, and frankly, sometimes frustrating area.  We’ve all been there, you know, spending weeks on an experiment only to find out your antibodies are… less than ideal.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Absolutely!  So, let's start with the basics.  For our listeners who aren't scientists, can you explain what the problem with antibodies is in simple terms?
[INFO] Joe: ** Sure.  The problem is basically this:  scientists rely heavily on antibodies to identify and study specific proteins in cells and tissues.  But many commercially available antibodies don't actually work as advertised. They might not bind to the target protein correctly, they might bind to other things too, or they might not even work at all. This makes research findings unreliable, difficult to reproduce, and sometimes, completely invalid.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's like buying a tool that's supposed to do one job, but it does something completely different, or nothing at all?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's... not a bad analogy, actually.  Though it's more nuanced than that.  It's not just about the tool being faulty; it's also about the lack of clear labeling and consistent identification.  Think of it like trying to find a specific screw in a hardware store with only a vague description.  You might find *something* that seems similar, but it might not fit.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right.  So, how are researchers trying to solve this?  I read about these RRIDs…
[INFO] Joe: **  Yes, Research Resource Identifiers, or RRIDs.  Think of them as unique, permanent serial numbers for antibodies and other research materials.  Before RRIDs,  many antibodies were described vaguely in publications, making it nearly impossible to track down the exact same batch used in a particular experiment.  RRIDs provide a way to uniquely identify each antibody, making replication much easier.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's like a universal product code for research materials?
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely!  It helps researchers find the *exact* antibody used in a previous study, increasing the chances of replicating the results.  It's a crucial step towards improving reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: **  And what about the issue of actually finding *good* antibodies?  The article mentioned CiteAb…
[INFO] Joe: **  CiteAb is a search engine specifically designed for antibodies. It compiles data on antibody usage and citations, giving researchers a better idea of which antibodies are reliable based on how often they've been successfully used in published research.  They also try to include validation data when available, but that's a big challenge.
[INFO] Sarah: **  A big challenge?  Why?
[INFO] Joe: **  Well, validating an antibody rigorously is a complex and time-consuming process. There isn't one single gold standard for validation.  Different methods exist, and even "validated" antibodies might not perform well in every application.  It's a complex problem with no easy fixes.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it sounds like there’s a lot of work to be done.  It’s almost like a whole ecosystem needs to change, right? Researchers, manufacturers, journals…everyone?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  That's where initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community come in. They're trying to bring all these stakeholders together—researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers—to collaboratively address this issue and improve the overall quality and reliability of antibodies in research.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That sounds promising. It seems like a collective effort is essential to tackle such a widespread problem. Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really enlightening.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah. It’s a complex issue, but hopefully, initiatives like RRIDs and OGA will make a real difference.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, you’ve laid out a pretty comprehensive picture of the antibody reproducibility crisis and the ongoing efforts to address it.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is, I think, the most significant development.  It's not just about *feeling* better; it's about eliminating a fundamental source of variability.  Traditional methods, using immune cells or hybridomas, inherently produce antibodies with batch-to-batch differences in their structure and, consequently, their performance.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  That’s what I found most striking.  The idea that the antibodies themselves weren't consistent – that's a huge problem, isn't it?  I mean, you're basing your entire research on something that might subtly change between experiments.  It makes it almost impossible to replicate results.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies, produced in genetically engineered cells, offer a solution to that. You're essentially programming the cells to produce a specific, defined antibody sequence.  This eliminates the inherent variability of the older methods.  Think of it like… well, forget analogies, it’s simpler to say this: with traditional methods, you're growing a field of slightly different plants, hoping they'll all be the same; with recombinant methods, you're cloning a specific plant, ensuring every plant is identical.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that's a helpful way to put it, even if you tried to avoid the analogy.  So, if the problem is solved at the production stage, why is changing scientist behavior still such a big hurdle?
[INFO] Joe: Um, because habits are hard to break.  Many researchers have established workflows using older, less reliable antibodies.  They might be getting results, even if those results aren't perfectly reproducible.  There's a significant inertia there, a reluctance to change established practices, even if those practices are flawed.  And, frankly, validating a new antibody can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
[INFO] Sarah: So it’s not just about the cost of the new antibodies themselves, but the time and effort to re-validate everything? That makes perfect sense. It's a substantial investment for scientists.  And you mentioned initiatives like RRIDs and OGA… how do those fit into this picture?
[INFO] Joe: They're crucial for improving transparency and data sharing. RRIDs provide unique identifiers for antibodies, making it easier to track their use and verify their provenance.  OGA, on the other hand, is fostering a community around best practices, promoting the use of validated antibodies, and encouraging researchers to share their data. They're essentially building a framework to support this shift towards better reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it’s a multi-pronged approach.  You need the technological advancements in antibody production, coupled with initiatives that encourage adoption and provide the tools for better data management.  And, of course, you need scientists to actually change their habits.  It’s a complex problem.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  It's not a simple fix, but the progress made so far, particularly the shift towards recombinants, is undeniably significant.  The future looks brighter, especially with the younger generation of scientists actively engaging in these initiatives.  There's a real sense of community forming around this, and that’s encouraging.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, you were just saying how researchers validate these antibodies.  That sounded… complicated.  Let’s break it down for our listeners.  You mentioned three methods, right?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yeah, three main ones.  Um, there's immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Immunohistochemistry, or IHC, is basically… well, it's like staining cells. You know, you have these cells, and you’re looking for a specific protein.  The antibody, if it works, will bind to that protein, and you can see it under a microscope.  It’s a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's like… highlighting the protein?  Like, if the protein's there, the antibody acts as a highlighter, making it visible?
[INFO] Joe: **  You could think of it that way, yeah.  A helpful analogy, although it’s not a perfect one.  The important thing is that it shows you *where* the protein is located within the cell.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay.  And what about Western blotting?
[INFO] Joe: **  Western blotting is different. It’s more about confirming the *size* and *presence* of the protein.  You run a sample through a gel, and the proteins separate based on their size. Then, you use the antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – a specific molecular weight, as we mentioned before.  If it does, you see a band on the blot – a visual indicator.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, IHC shows location, Western blotting shows size and presence.  Got it.  And immunoprecipitation? That sounds the most… technical.
[INFO] Joe: **  It is a bit more involved.  Here, you use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it like fishing with a magnet – the antibody is the magnet, and the protein is the metal.  Once you've "fished" the protein, you can then use other techniques, like mass spectrometry, to confirm its identity.  It's a more precise method for identifying a specific protein within a complex sample.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's like a more targeted approach to isolation and identification?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  It's more powerful, but also more complex to perform.  Each method has its strengths and weaknesses.  Often, researchers use a combination of these techniques to get a more complete picture.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That makes a lot more sense now. So, it's not just one test, but rather a combination of tests to really confirm the antibody's effectiveness.  It's a pretty rigorous process.  I can see why you might feel frustrated with the level of validation needed sometimes.
[INFO] Joe: **  It is rigorous, and it can be frustrating.  But that rigor is essential for ensuring the reliability of scientific findings.  You know, ultimately, it's all about ensuring that the results are accurate and trustworthy.  And that's what keeps me going, even on the toughest days.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's a good point, Joe.  It's about the integrity of the science, and the impact that reliable findings can have.
[INFO] Joe: ** Precisely. And the fact that we're making progress, even if slowly, is hugely motivating.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Absolutely.  Well, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking down these complex processes for us.
[INFO] Joe: **  My pleasure, Sarah.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, before we wrap up, can you just reiterate why these validation methods are so important?
[INFO] Joe: ** Of course.  These methods are crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of research using antibodies.  Incorrectly validated antibodies can lead to inaccurate results, potentially wasting time, resources, and even leading to flawed conclusions in research.
