Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it.  It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.  When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein.  The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates.  There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says.  He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell.  So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available.  They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72.  When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades.  Several fresh initiativeshope to change this.  By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules.  But not one published study had used these antibodies.  About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing.  And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1.  Laflammes experience isnt unusual.  Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets.  The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.  Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research.  He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Ope...

[2024-12-09T21:07:44.739Z] [INFO] Sarah: Wow, Joe, that's a shocking story! I had no idea the problem with unreliable antibodies was so widespread. It's scary to think that so many research findings could be based on inaccurate data.

Joe: Yeah, it's definitely a major issue. Thankfully, there's a rising awareness of the problem, and several initiatives are trying to tackle it. One example is Antibody Characterization through Open Resources (ACOR), which Laflamme and Edwards co-founded. 

Sarah: Interesting. How does ACOR work? 

Joe: ACOR is an open-access platform where researchers can share data about antibody performance. They can upload information about the antibodies they've tested, including their target protein, specificity, and validation methods. 

Sarah: So it's like a giant database of antibody quality assessments? 

Joe: Exactly. And it's not just a repository. ACOR also provides tools and guidelines to help researchers characterize antibodies themselves. They offer training workshops and even provide funding for researchers to test antibodies.

Sarah: That sounds incredibly valuable. Do you think initiatives like ACOR can really make a difference? 

Joe: I believe so. By making antibody performance data readily available and empowering researchers to do their own testing, ACOR can help improve the overall quality of research. This could lead to more accurate findings, better reproducibility, and ultimately, faster progress in science and medicine. 

Sarah: I hope you're right. It would be amazing if we could eliminate the problem of unreliable antibodies and ensure that scientific research is built on a solid foundation of accurate data. 

Joe: Absolutely. Imagine the impact that could have on drug development, disease diagnosis, and overall scientific understanding. It's an exciting time to be involved in this effort.

Sarah: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge.  The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.  YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate).  In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2.  Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers.  It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS.  It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work.  Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023.  They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market.  The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins.  Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says.  He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names).  I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.  But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says.  The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform.  Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge.  Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs).  OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen.  Unlike YCharOS, which foc...

[2024-12-09T21:07:58.491Z] [INFO] **Joe:** Hey Sarah, thanks for joining me today. I'm really excited to talk about this initiative called YCharOS. It's a pretty big deal in the antibody research world.

**Sarah:** No problem, Joe. I'm definitely curious. I've heard about YCharOS, but I'm not entirely sure what it's all about. Can you give me a quick overview?

**Joe:** Sure. Basically, YCharOS is a project aimed at improving the quality and reliability of antibodies used in research. You see, antibodies are these amazing tools that scientists use to study proteins, which are the workhorses of our cells. But the problem is, a lot of antibodies out there don't actually work as well as they're supposed to. They might not be specific enough, they might bind to the wrong protein, or they might just not work at all. This can lead to a lot of wasted time, money, and effort in research.

**Sarah:** Wow, I didn't realize it was such a widespread problem. So, what exactly does YCharOS do to address this?

**Joe:** Well, they have a few different strategies. One of the main things they do is test antibodies to see how well they actually perform. They use a variety of techniques to assess things like specificity, sensitivity, and affinity. They also compare different antibodies that are supposed to target the same protein to see which ones work best.

**Sarah:** Okay, so they're basically like quality control for antibodies?

**Joe:** Exactly. And they make all of their data publicly available, so researchers can see for themselves how different antibodies perform before they even buy them. This can save a lot of time and frustration in the lab.

**Sarah:** That sounds really valuable. But how do they get all these antibodies to test?

Joe: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step.  In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use.  In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies.  Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations.  In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site.  The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says.  Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS.  Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says.  Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies.  In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation.  But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.  When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time.  That was a shock, Virk says.  At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point.  Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies.  In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.  They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research.  Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.  Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality.  It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences.  The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices.  Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.  Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance.  In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made.  The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody.  Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods.  A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[2024-12-09T21:08:05.532Z] [INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah Discuss Antibody Reliability

**Joe:** Hey Sarah, welcome back to the podcast! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of antibodies and their reliability in research. 

**Sarah:**  Thanks, Joe. I'm excited to chat about this. Antibodies are used in so many experiments, so understanding their reliability is crucial for accurate and reproducible research. 

**Joe:** Absolutely. And it's not just about accuracy, it's also about ethical considerations and minimizing animal use. 

**Sarah:** Right, and it seems like there have been some recent initiatives to address this issue. Can you tell us more about them?

**Joe:** Definitely. One interesting development is the YCharOS platform, which provides open-access characterization data for antibodies. This helps researchers select the most reliable antibodies for their experiments. 

**Sarah:** That sounds like a valuable resource. But isn't there more to it than just having data?

**Joe:** Absolutely. That's where initiatives like CiteAb come in. It's a search engine that helps researchers find the most highly cited antibodies, which can be a good indicator of reliability. 

**Sarah:** But even highly cited antibodies can be problematic, right? What about the issue of validation?

**Joe:** You're right. Ideally, antibodies should be validated through knock-out experiments. However, less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated this way. 

**Sarah:** Wow, that's a surprisingly low number. What are some of the challenges in getting antibodies validated?

**Joe:** Well, it's a time-consuming and expensive process. And there's no single standard for validation, which makes it difficult to compare results from different studies. 

**Sarah:** So, what are some of the solutions being proposed?

**Joe:** One promising approach is the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community. They're working on developing best practices for antibody selection and validation, and they're also advocating for better collaboration between researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies. 

**Sarah:** It's encouraging to see these collaborative efforts. What role do manufacturers play in improving antibody reliability?

**Joe:** Manufacturers are increasingly producing recombinant antibodies, which are more standardized and reproducible than traditional antibodies. And some companies are even conducting their own knock-out validations. 

**Sarah:** That's great news. So, what does the future hold for antibody reliability?

**Joe:** I think we're moving in the right direction. With continued collaboration and innovation, we can ensure that researchers have access to the reliable antibodies they need to conduct high-quality, reproducible research. 

**Sarah:** This is a crucial step forward for science, not only improving accuracy and efficiency but also minimizing the use of animals in research. 

**Joe:** Absolutely. By prioritizing antibody reliability, we can pave the way for more robust and ethical scientific discoveries. 

**Sarah:** Thanks for sharing your insights, Joe. This has been a fascinating discussion. 

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. I hope this conversation helps raise awareness about the importance of antibody reliability in research.

Sarah: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry.  Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight.  And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry.

[2024-12-09T21:08:13.424Z] [INFO] ## The Antibody Revolution: A Conversation with Sarah and Joe

**Sarah:** Hey Joe, thanks for joining me today. We're here to talk about antibodies, which are experiencing a bit of a revolution in the scientific world. I've been reading some fascinating articles about how scientists are finally starting to take antibody validation seriously.

**Joe:** Absolutely, Sarah. I'm excited to chat about this. It's definitely a topic that's been gaining a lot of traction lately, and for good reason. Antibodies are incredibly powerful tools, but their reliability has been a major concern for researchers.

**Sarah:** Exactly. I mean, imagine spending months on an experiment, only to find out that the antibody you used wasn't actually binding to the protein you thought it was. That's a nightmare scenario.

**Joe:** It happens more often than you'd think. Studies have shown that a significant portion of published research uses antibodies that haven't been properly validated. This can lead to inaccurate results, wasted time and resources, and even misleading conclusions.

**Sarah:** So, what's changed? Why are scientists finally starting to take this seriously?

**Joe:** I think it's a combination of factors. Firstly, there's been a growing awareness of the problem. More and more researchers are realizing that antibody validation is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of their work.

**Sarah:** And secondly?

**Joe:** Secondly, there are now more tools and resources available to help scientists validate their antibodies. Companies like CiteAb have developed databases and platforms that make it easier to find information about antibody performance and reliability.

**Sarah:** That's great to hear. But what about the researchers who are resistant to change? You mentioned in your article that some scientists are reluctant to admit that their antibodies might not be working.

**Joe:** It's true, there's definitely some resistance. Some researchers might feel like they're being told they've been doing things wrong all along. But ultimately, I think most scientists just want to do good science. They want to be confident that their results are accurate and reliable.

**Sarah:** And that's what antibody validation helps them achieve.

**Joe:** Exactly. By taking the time to validate their antibodies, researchers can be sure that they're using the best possible tools for their experiments. This will ultimately lead to more accurate and reliable research, which benefits everyone.

**Sarah:** So, what does the future hold for antibodies?

**Joe:** I think the future is bright. As more and more researchers embrace antibody validation, we'll see a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of scientific research. This will have a positive impact on all areas of science, from basic research to clinical trials.

**Sarah:** I couldn't agree more. This is a really exciting time for the scientific community. Thanks for sharing your insights, Joe.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. It's been a great conversation.

**Visionary Statement:**

The antibody revolution is not just about improving the accuracy of individual experiments. It's about changing the culture of scientific research, making it more rigorous and reliable. This will ultimately lead to breakthroughs in all areas of science and medicine, improving the lives of countless people around the world.
