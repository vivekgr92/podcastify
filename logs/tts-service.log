Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1. Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells. When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7. 7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating.

[INFO] Raw response: ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah Discuss the Antibody Problem

**Joe:**

So, Sarah, I'm really excited to talk about this initiative called YCharOS, which is trying to tackle the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. As you know, these molecules are essential tools for biologists, but unfortunately, a lot of them just don't work as well as they should. This can lead to wasted time, resources, and even misleading results, which is a major issue for the scientific community.

**Sarah:**

Absolutely. I've definitely come across my fair share of frustrating antibody experiences. Can you tell me more about YCharOS and how it's trying to address this problem?

**Joe:**

Sure. YCharOS stands for Antibody Characterization through Open Science. It's basically a collaborative effort between researchers and antibody companies to systematically evaluate the performance of commercially available antibodies. They're focusing on antibodies for every human protein, which is a huge undertaking.

**Sarah:**

Wow, that's ambitious! But how exactly are they going about this evaluation process?

**Joe:**

They're using a variety of techniques to assess both the specificity and selectivity of each antibody. Specificity means that the antibody binds to the target protein and nothing else, while selectivity means that it doesn't bind to other similar proteins that might be present in the cell.

**Sarah:**

That makes sense. So, what happens after they've evaluated all these antibodies?

**Joe:**

The results will be made publicly available through an online database. This will allow researchers to easily find information about which antibodies are reliable and which ones to avoid. It's kind of like Consumer Reports for antibodies.

**Sarah:**

That's fantastic! I can see how that would be incredibly helpful for researchers. But what about the companies that are making these antibodies? Are they on board with this initiative?

**Joe:**

Surprisingly, yes! Many of the major antibody vendors are actually collaborating with YCharOS. They recognize that the current situation is unsustainable and that improving the quality of their products will ultimately benefit everyone.

**Sarah:**

That's great news. It sounds like YCharOS has the potential to really make a difference in the field. But beyond just evaluating existing antibodies, are there efforts to develop better ones in the first place?

**Joe:**

Definitely. There are several groups working on new technologies for producing antibodies with higher specificity and selectivity. There's also a growing movement to promote best practices when it comes to choosing and working with antibodies.

**Sarah:**

It seems like there's a lot of momentum behind this effort to improve the situation with antibodies. Do you think we'll see a significant change in the next few years?

**Joe:**

I'm optimistic. I think YCharOS and other initiatives like it are making a real difference. With increased awareness, better tools, and collaboration between researchers and companies, I believe we can overcome the antibody problem and ensure that scientists have the reliable tools they need to make groundbreaking discoveries.

**Sarah:**

I couldn't agree more. This could have a major impact on the future of scientific research and ultimately benefit society as a whole.

**Joe:**

Exactly. By ensuring the accuracy and reliability of research, we can accelerate progress in areas like medicine, agriculture, and environmental science. It's an exciting time to be a scientist!

Sarah: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2. Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1. 6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test. Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says.

Previous response: ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah Discuss Antibody Validation Joe: Hey Sarah, welcome back to the podcast! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of antibody validation. As you know, antibodies are critical tools for research, but their reliability can be surprisingly inconsistent. That's where initiatives like YCharOS come in. Sarah: Absolutely. I've definitely had my share of frustrating experiences with antibodies that just don't work as expected. So, tell me more about YCharOS and how it's tackling this problem. Joe: YCharOS stands for Antibody Characterization through Open Science. It's essentially a collaborative effort between researchers and antibody companies to systematically evaluate the performance of commercially available antibodies. Their focus is on antibodies for every human protein, which is a massive undertaking. Sarah: Wow, that's ambitious! But how exactly are they going about this evaluation process? Joe: They use various techniques to assess both the specificity and selectivity of each antibody. Specificity means that the antibody binds to the target protein and nothing else, while selectivity means that it doesn't bind to other similar proteins that might be present in the cell. Sarah: That makes sense. So, what happens after they've evaluated all these antibodies? Joe: The results are made publicly available through an online database. This allows researchers to easily find information about which antibodies are reliable and which ones to avoid. It's kind of like Consumer Reports for antibodies. Sarah: That's fantastic! I can see how that would be incredibly helpful for researchers. But what about the companies that are making these antibodies? Are they on board with this initiative? Joe: Surprisingly, yes! Many of the major antibody vendors are actually collaborating with YCharOS. They recognize that the current situation is unsustainable and that improving the quality of their products will ultimately benefit everyone. Sarah: That's great news. It sounds like YCharOS has the potential to really make a difference in the field. But beyond just evaluating existing antibodies, are there efforts to develop better ones in the first place? Joe: Definitely. There are several groups working on new technologies for producing antibodies with higher specificity and selectivity. There's also a growing movement to promote best practices when it comes to choosing and working with antibodies. Sarah: It seems like there's a lot of momentum behind this effort to improve the situation with antibodies. Do you think we'll see a significant change in the next few years? Joe: I'm optimistic. I think YCharOS and other initiatives like it are making a real difference.

Joe: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point. Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies. They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4. Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[INFO] Raw response: Joe: Ah, right. So, where were we? Ah, yes. So, this shift towards recombinant antibodies is definitely a step in the right direction. But it's important to remember that even the best antibodies can be used incorrectly. That's why it's so important for researchers to have access to good training and resources on how to properly use and validate antibodies.

Sarah: Absolutely. I think that's often overlooked. It's not just about having the right tools, but also knowing how to use them effectively.

Joe: Exactly. And that's where initiatives like the Antibody Validation Network (AVN) come in. The AVN is a community of researchers, antibody companies, and other stakeholders who are working together to develop and share best practices for antibody validation.

Sarah: That sounds like a valuable resource. But how do they go about developing these best practices?

Joe: Well, they do it through a variety of ways, including workshops, webinars, and online resources. They also have a working group that is specifically focused on developing guidelines for antibody validation.

Sarah: It's encouraging to see so many different groups working together to tackle this problem. Do you think we're finally starting to turn the corner on the antibody crisis?

Joe: I think we're definitely moving in the right direction. With all of these initiatives in place, I'm optimistic that we'll see a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of antibody research in the years to come.

Sarah: That would be a huge step forward for science. And not just for science, but for society as a whole. After all, many of the most important breakthroughs in medicine and other fields rely on antibodies. So, by improving the reliability of antibody research, we're ultimately helping to improve the lives of people around the world.

Sarah: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

[INFO] Raw response: Sarah: Wow, that's quite a statement from Diana Kwon. It definitely highlights the challenges we face in the scientific community regarding antibody reliability. Joe, as someone who's deeply involved in this field, what are your thoughts on this?

Joe: You're right, Sarah, it's a complex issue with no easy solutions. But I'm optimistic that we're moving in the right direction. The shift towards recombinant antibodies is definitely a step in the right direction. These antibodies are produced in controlled environments, making them more consistent and reliable than traditional polyclonal antibodies.

Sarah: That's true, but even with recombinant antibodies, there's still the issue of validation. How can we be sure that the antibodies are actually doing what they're supposed to do?

Joe: You're absolutely right. Validation is crucial, and it's something that needs to be done rigorously. There are a number of different methods that can be used, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the right method for the specific application.

Sarah: Can you explain these methods in a bit more detail? I'm not familiar with all of them.

Joe: Sure, let's start with immunohistochemistry. This technique involves staining a sample of cells with the antibody. If the antibody binds to the target protein, it will be visible under a microscope. This method is relatively simple and straightforward, but it can be difficult to quantify the results.

Sarah: What about Western blotting?

Joe: Western blotting is another common method for validating antibodies. This technique separates proteins based on their size and then detects the presence of the target protein using the antibody. This method is more quantitative than immunohistochemistry, but it requires more specialized equipment and expertise.

Sarah: And finally, immunoprecipitation?

Joe: Immunoprecipitation is a technique that allows you to isolate the target protein from a mixture of other proteins. This can be useful for confirming the identity of the protein and for studying its interactions with other proteins.

Sarah: These all sound like valuable tools for validating antibodies. But how do we know which method is the best for a particular application?

Joe: That's a good question. The best method will depend on the specific antibody and the application. For example, if you're looking for a simple and quick way to validate an antibody, immunohistochemistry might be a good option. However, if you need more quantitative results, Western blotting or immunoprecipitation might be better choices.

Sarah: That makes sense. So, it's really important for researchers to understand the different validation methods and choose the right one for their needs.

Joe: Absolutely. And it's also important to remember that validation is an ongoing process. As we learn more about antibodies and their interactions with cells and tissues, we may need to refine our validation methods.

Sarah: That's a great point. This is a constantly evolving field, and it's important for researchers to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.

Joe: Exactly. And I think that's one of the reasons why initiatives like the Antibody Validation Network (AVN) are so important. The AVN is a community of researchers, antibody companies, and other stakeholders who are working together to develop and share best practices for antibody validation.

You're absolutely right. Validation is crucial, and it's something that needs to be done rigorously. There are a number of different methods that can be used, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the right method for the specific application. Can you explain these methods in a bit more detail? I'm not familiar with all of them. Sure, let's start with immunohistochemistry. This technique involves staining a sample of cells with the antibody. If the antibody binds to the target protein, it will be visible under a microscope. This method is relatively simple and straightforward, but it can be difficult to quantify the results. What about Western blotting? Western blotting is another common method for validating antibodies. This technique separates proteins based on their size and then detects the presence of the target protein using the antibody. This method is more quantitative than immunohistochemistry, but it requires more specialized equipment and expertise. And finally, immunoprecipitation? Immunoprecipitation is a technique that allows you to isolate the target protein from a mixture of other proteins. This can be useful for confirming the identity of the protein and for studying its interactions with other proteins. These all sound like valuable tools for validating antibodies. But how do we know which method is the best for a particular application? That's a good question. The best method will depend on the specific antibody and the application. For example, if you're looking for a simple and quick way to validate an antibody, immunohistochemistry might be a good option. However, if you need more quantitative results, Western blotting or immunoprecipitation might be better choices. That makes sense. So, it's really important for researchers to understand the different validation methods and choose the right one for their needs. Absolutely. And it's also important to remember that validation is an ongoing process. As we learn more about antibodies and their interactions with cells and tissues, we may need to refine our validation methods. That's a great point. This is a constantly evolving field, and it's important for researchers to stay up-to-date on the latest developments. Exactly. And I think that's one of the reasons why initiatives like the Antibody Validation Network (AVN) are so important. The AVN is a community of researchers, antibody companies, and other stakeholders who are working together to develop and share best practices for antibody validation. That sounds like a valuable resource. But how do they go about developing these best practices? Well, they do it through a variety of ways, including workshops, webinars, and online resources. They also have a working group that is specifically focused on developing guidelines for antibody validation. It's encouraging to see so many different groups working together to tackle this problem. Do you think we're finally starting to turn the corner on the antibody crisis? I think we're definitely moving in the right direction. With all of these initiatives in place, I'm optimistic that we'll see a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of antibody research in the years to come. That would be a huge step forward for science. And not just for science, but for society as a whole. After all, many of the most important breakthroughs in medicine and other fields rely on antibodies. So, by improving the reliability of antibody research, we're ultimately helping to improve the lives of people around the world. I couldn't agree more, Sarah. It's an exciting time to be involved in this field. And on that note, I think it's time to wrap things up for today. Thanks again for joining me, Joe. It was my pleasure, Sarah.
