Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Podify, where we explore fascinating topics and stories from around the world. Today, we're diving into the world of scientific research, specifically the challenges scientists face with unreliable antibodies.  It sounds a bit technical, but trust me, it's a really interesting story about how a simple tool can massively impact scientific breakthroughs â€“ or even hold them back.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher studying motor neuron disease, discovered a huge problem: many commercially available antibodies used in labs simply didn't work as advertised.  He was trying to study a specific protein linked to the disease, but the existing antibodies were giving him conflicting and unreliable results.  He tested sixteen different commercial antibodies, and only three actually worked properly!  Fifteen others didn't even bind to the correct protein, and yet studies using these faulty antibodies had been published and cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow, that's shocking! Thousands of citations based on unreliable data? That seems like a huge problem for the whole field of research. How did that happen?  I mean, surely there are checks and balances in place to prevent this kind of thing?

Joe: That's a great question, Sarah.  The problem is that for decades, scientists have relied on these antibodies without always properly testing their quality.  Essentially, they were trusting the companies selling them.  It's a bit like buying a tool from a hardware store and assuming it'll work perfectly, without checking it yourself.  This lack of rigorous testing, coupled with the pressure to publish research quickly, has led to a lot of unreliable data.  It's contributed to what's called a "reproducibility crisis" in science â€“ where other researchers find it difficult to repeat the results of published studies.  This wastes time, money, and ultimately slows down the progress of scientific discovery.

Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope for more reliable research in the future?

Joe: Absolutely!  Scientists are taking action.  Laflamme, for example, teamed up with another researcher to create an initiative called iCharOS â€“ that's Icarus â€“ aimed at characterizing every human protein antibody. This means thoroughly testing every antibody to make sure it's reliable.  There are other efforts too: creating better antibodies, making it easier for researchers to find the good ones, and encouraging better practices within the scientific community. Antibody vendors, funding agencies, and even scientific publishers are getting involved. It's a huge collaborative effort to solve a long-standing problem.  It's a slow process, but there's definitely hope that things will improve.  It's a reminder that even the smallest tools in scientific research need to be rigorously checked to ensure reliable and reproducible results.

Absolutely!  Scientists are taking action.  Laflamme, for example, teamed up with another researcher to create an initiative called iCharOS â€“ that's Icarus â€“ aimed at characterizing every human protein antibody. This means thoroughly testing every antibody to make sure it's reliable.

It's a reminder that even the smallest tools in scientific research need to be rigorously checked to ensure reliable and reproducible results.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Joe:** Hi everyone, and welcome back to the podcast! Today, Sarah and I are diving back into the world of scientific research, specifically the surprisingly tricky world of antibodies.

**Sarah:**  That's right, Joe. Last time we talked about how crucial antibodies are in research, but also how unreliable some commercially available ones can be.  It's like buying a tool that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't â€“ not very helpful for accurate scientific results!

**Joe:** Exactly!  And that's a HUGE problem.  We talked about the iCharOS initiative â€“ but there are others springing up, trying to tackle this issue.  Sarah, you've done some digging into this, right? Tell us more about these efforts.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  One of the most impressive is iCharOS (Icarus), which is really focusing on testing a massive number of antibodies. They're working directly with antibody suppliers â€“ getting the antibodies for testing free of charge!  They're rigorously testing them to see if they actually bind to the intended protein target, and publishing their findings.  The amazing thing is, they've already tested over a thousand antibodies, and found that two-thirds of them didn't work as advertised by the manufacturers.  

**Joe:** Wow, two-thirds!  That's a shockingly high failure rate.  So what happens when iCharOS finds a faulty antibody?

**Sarah:**  Well, the manufacturers are actually responding!  They're reassessing these antibodies, updating their recommendations, or even pulling some from the market entirely. It's a huge collaborative effort, and it's showing results.

**Joe:** That's fantastic to hear! It shows that this collaborative approach is really making a difference.  But as you mentioned, itâ€™s not a perfect solution, right?

**Sarah:**  Right.  Even with iCharOS, there are limitations.  An antibody might work perfectly in one specific test, but behave differently in another context â€“ a different cell type, a different tissue, or a different experimental technique.  That's where another initiative comes in: OMAPs (Organ Mapping Antibody Panels).

**Joe:**  So OMAPs tackles this "context" problem?

**Sarah:** Exactly.  Instead of focusing on one specific test for many antibodies, OMAPs focuses on one specific application â€“ like imaging â€“ but tests it across many different contexts.  They're getting researchers from universities and companies to test these antibodies in their own labs to see how they perform.  It's a really smart way of getting a broader picture of how reliable an antibody is.

**Joe:** This sounds like a really exciting and much-needed development in scientific research.  It highlights the importance of collaboration and rigorous testing, even for something as seemingly simple as an antibody.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  Itâ€™s a reminder that even the smallest tools in science need careful evaluation to ensure reliable and reproducible results, paving the way for more accurate and trustworthy scientific discoveries.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

It's easy to think of scientific research as all fancy equipment and complex experiments, but the reality is that even the smallest components can have a huge impact on the results.  And antibodies, these tiny workhorses, are a prime example.  We heard last time that even the best antibodies aren't always easy to find.

**Joe:** Right.  Imagine trying to find a specific screw in a massive hardware store with no clear labeling system â€“ that's kind of what it was like for researchers before some smart people stepped in.  We learned about Anita Bandrowski and her work on RRIDs â€“ research resource identifiers.  These are like unique serial numbers for antibodies, making them much easier to track down and ensuring everyone's using the same thing.

**Sarah:**  It's like a digital inventory system for scientific resources!  Itâ€™s a huge step forward for reproducibility. But even with RRIDs, finding a *good* antibody is still a challenge.  We also heard about CiteAb, a search engine specifically for antibodies, which helps researchers find the most highly cited ones.  That sounds helpful, but even then, it's not a guarantee of quality.

**Joe:** That's the crux of the problem, Sarah.  Just because an antibody is highly cited doesn't mean it's reliable.  We heard from Dr. Virk, who had a really frustrating experience with unreliable antibodies.  It almost drove him out of science!

**Sarah:**  That's shocking, but it highlights the real-world impact of this issue.  Itâ€™s not just about inconvenience; it's about wasted time, money, and potentially, incorrect scientific conclusions. That's why Dr. Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community.

**Joe:**  OGA is bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies â€“ everyone involved â€“ to collaborate on solutions.  They're tackling this problem head-on, which is exactly the kind of collaborative effort we need to see more of in science.

**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  It's a reminder that science isn't done in isolation.  It's a team effort, and improving the reliability of even something as seemingly small as an antibody requires a collective effort from all stakeholders.

**Joe:**  It's a fascinating look behind the scenes of scientific research, highlighting the importance of careful attention to detail and the power of collaboration.  And it's a reminder that even the most basic tools need constant evaluation and improvement.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 **(Intro music fades)**

**Joe:** Welcome back to the show, everyone! Today, Sarah and I are diving into the fascinating, and slightly messy, world of scientific antibodies.  Last time, we talked about the importance of reproducibility in research.  This week, weâ€™re focusing on one key area where that reproducibility has been a real challenge: antibodies.

**Sarah:** Exactly, Joe! Antibodies are these incredibly important tools used in countless scientific experiments, from medical research to developing new drugs. But for a long time, there's been a serious problem:  a lot of antibodies just didn't work as advertised, or worked inconsistently. This made it really difficult to replicate results, leading to wasted time, money, and potentially, flawed conclusions.

**Joe:**  So, what's the problem with these antibodies?  Are they justâ€¦badly made?

**Sarah:** It's more complicated than that. Traditionally, many antibodies were created using methods that produced batches with variations.  Think of it like baking a cake â€“ if your recipe isn't precise, each cake will be slightly different.  This inconsistency in antibodies meant that experiments using them couldn't always be reliably repeated.

**Joe:**  I see. So, scientists were essentially working with slightly different ingredients every time.

**Sarah:** Precisely!  But things are changing. A big push is underway to switch to something called "recombinant antibodies."  These are made using genetically engineered cells, so you get a consistent product every time â€“ like having a perfect, foolproof cake recipe.

**Joe:**  That sounds like a huge improvement!  Are all scientists on board with this change?

**Sarah:** Not yet.  There's been some resistance, with some researchers hesitant to switch from what they're used to.  Plus, switching over requires effort and validation.  But there's been a lot of progress.  Organizations like the OGA (Open Global Antibodies) community are working hard to improve antibody quality, provide better resources for researchers, and even incentivize the use of better antibodies through grants.  Antibody suppliers are also stepping up, producing more of these reliable recombinant antibodies.

**Joe:** It's great to hear that there's a collaborative effort to tackle this problem!  It really highlights how important it is for scientists to work together and share information.

**Sarah:** Absolutely!  And it also shows that even the most fundamental tools in science need constant evaluation and improvement. This whole antibody story is a great example of how science is a self-correcting process.  The problems are being identified, and the scientific community is actively working towards solutions.

**(Short musical interlude)**

**Joe:**  So, what's the takeaway for our listeners?

**Sarah:**  Even though there are still challenges, the future of antibody research looks much brighter.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies, along with the collaborative efforts of scientists, organizations, and manufacturers, is paving the way for more reliable and reproducible scientific research.  It's a reminder that science is a continuous journey of improvement, and that even seemingly small details can have a huge impact on the bigger picture.

**Joe:**  Exactly! And that's all the time we have for today.  Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time!

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.
