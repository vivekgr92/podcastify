Previous Response: Current chunk: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1. Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells. When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7. 7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating.

[INFO] Raw response: ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah on Antibody Characterization

**Joe:** So, as we were discussing, the problem of unreliable antibodies has been a major concern in research for quite some time. It's estimated that up to 50% of commercially available antibodies may not work as advertised, which can lead to a lot of wasted time, resources, and even misleading results.

**Sarah:** Wow, that's a staggering number. And it's understandable why this would be a major issue, especially when you consider the crucial role antibodies play in so many different research areas.

**Joe:** Exactly. Antibodies are fundamental tools for various techniques, from protein detection and quantification to immunoprecipitation and cell sorting. So, having unreliable antibodies can really throw a wrench in the works.

**Sarah:** Right. And it's not just about wasted resources, but also the potential for inaccurate conclusions and even misleading publications. This could have serious implications for scientific progress and even patient care in some cases.

**Joe:** Absolutely. That's why initiatives like YCharOS are so important. By independently characterizing and validating commercially available antibodies, they can help researchers make informed choices and ensure that their experiments are based on reliable data.

**Sarah:** It's also encouraging to see the collaboration between YCharOS and antibody vendors. This kind of industry-wide effort is crucial for tackling this problem effectively.

**Joe:** Definitely. And it's not just about characterizing existing antibodies. There's also a lot of research going into developing new and improved antibodies with higher specificity and selectivity.

**Sarah:** That sounds promising. Do you think we'll eventually reach a point where unreliable antibodies are a thing of the past?

**Joe:** It's hard to say for sure, but I think we're definitely moving in the right direction. With increased awareness, better characterization methods, and ongoing research efforts, I'm optimistic that we can significantly improve the reliability and quality of antibodies used in research.

**Sarah:** That would be a huge leap forward for science. Reliable antibodies could not only accelerate research but also lead to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments for various diseases.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And it's not just about the immediate benefits. By ensuring the integrity of scientific data, we can build a stronger foundation for future discoveries and ultimately contribute to a healthier and more prosperous future for everyone.

**Sarah:** Well said, Joe. I think that's a very inspiring vision for the impact this work can have on science and society as a whole.

Current chunk: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2. Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1. 6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test. Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, as we were discussing, YCharOS's work relies heavily on collaboration with industry partners. These partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge, and are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. This collaborative approach helps ensure transparency and allows the vendors to improve their products based on the insights gained through YCharOS's rigorous assessments.

**Sarah:** That's interesting. So, how exactly does YCharOS test these antibodies? 

**Joe:** They compare the antibody's specificity in two different cell lines. One line expresses the target protein at normal biological levels, while the other is a "knockout" cell line that lacks the protein entirely. This allows them to assess the antibody's ability to bind specifically to its intended target and avoid off-target interactions.

**Sarah:** That sounds like a pretty thorough approach. And what happens after the testing?

**Joe:** The results are published in open-access reports, readily accessible to researchers. The vendors can then reassess the underperforming antibodies, update their recommendations, or even remove them from the market if necessary. In fact, in a recent analysis published in eLife, YCharOS assessed over 600 commercial antibodies and found that two-thirds of them didn't perform as advertised by the manufacturers.

**Sarah:** Wow, that's a pretty significant discrepancy! It just highlights how crucial initiatives like YCharOS are for ensuring reliable antibody use in research.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And the impact extends beyond individual labs. By making these assessments publicly available, YCharOS helps researchers make informed choices about which antibodies to use, ultimately improving the quality and reproducibility of research across the board.

**Sarah:** So, what's next for YCharOS? They've already tested over 1,000 antibodies, but there are still many more out there.

**Joe:** You're right. They estimate that there are around 200,000 unique antibodies out of the 1.6 million commercially available ones. So there's still a lot of work ahead. But they are continuously expanding their efforts and collaborating with other initiatives, like the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs), to address these challenges comprehensively.

**Sarah:** It's encouraging to see the scientific community coming together to tackle this issue collaboratively. I think initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs have the potential to revolutionize the way we use and validate antibodies, ultimately leading to more reliable and impactful research. 

**Joe:** I completely agree, Sarah. And the benefits extend beyond academia. By ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of research, we lay the foundation for reliable scientific discoveries that can ultimately translate into better healthcare, new diagnostic tools, and a deeper understanding of human health and disease.

**Sarah:** That's a truly visionary outlook, Joe. It's exciting to think about the potential impact this work can have on society as a whole.

It's encouraging to see the scientific community coming together to tackle this issue collaboratively. I think initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs have the potential to revolutionize the way we use and validate antibodies, ultimately leading to more reliable and impactful research. I completely agree, Sarah. And the benefits extend beyond academia. By ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of research, we lay the foundation for reliable scientific discoveries that can ultimately translate into better healthcare, new diagnostic tools, and a deeper understanding of human health and disease. That's a truly visionary outlook, Joe. It's exciting to think about the potential impact this work can have on society as a whole.

Current chunk: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point. Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies. They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4. Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[INFO] Raw response: ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah on Antibody Characterization (Continued)

**Sarah:** That's a fascinating initiative, Joe. So, how does CiteAb actually integrate YCharOS's data?

**Joe:** Well, they've created a dedicated section on their platform specifically for antibody characterization data. When you search for an antibody on CiteAb, you'll see a new tab labeled "Validation." If YCharOS has assessed that antibody, you'll find a summary of their findings there, including details about the target protein, the cell lines used, and the performance metrics.

**Sarah:** That sounds incredibly useful! So, researchers can now easily access information about an antibody's reliability directly within their search results.

**Joe:** Exactly. And CiteAb isn't the only platform integrating YCharOS's data. The Human Antibody Initiative (HAI) has also begun incorporating their assessments into their database. This means researchers have multiple avenues for accessing this crucial information.

**Sarah:** That's fantastic news! It seems like the scientific community is really starting to take antibody characterization seriously. But what about the manufacturers themselves? Are they playing a role in this effort?

**Joe:** Absolutely. Many manufacturers are now conducting their own knock-out validations and providing this information to researchers. Some are even taking it a step further by shifting towards producing recombinant antibodies, which offer greater consistency and batch-to-batch reproducibility.

**Sarah:** That's encouraging to hear. It seems like there's a real shift happening in the antibody research landscape.

**Joe:** I completely agree, Sarah. Initiatives like YCharOS, CiteAb, and the HAI are paving the way for a future where antibody-based research is more reliable and reproducible than ever before. This will ultimately lead to better science, better healthcare, and a deeper understanding of human health and disease.

**Sarah:** That's a truly visionary outlook, Joe. It's exciting to think about the potential impact this work can have on society as a whole.

**Joe:** I couldn't agree more, Sarah. The future of antibody research is bright, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

Current chunk: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

**Joe:** Wow, Sarah, that quote really hits home. It's true, the lack of reliability in antibody research can be incredibly frustrating and even discouraging for some scientists. But it's important to remember that the situation is improving, thanks to initiatives like YCharOS and the growing awareness of the issue. 

**Sarah:** Absolutely. It's encouraging to see the scientific community taking steps to address this problem. But you mentioned that changing scientists' behavior is one of the biggest challenges. How do we overcome that?

**Joe:** Well, it's a multifaceted approach. Firstly, we need to continue raising awareness about the importance of antibody validation. Platforms like CiteAb and the HAI are doing a great job of making this information readily available to researchers. 

**Sarah:** Right, and I think education plays a crucial role too. We need to ensure that scientists are properly trained in antibody validation techniques and understand the potential pitfalls of using unreliable antibodies. 

**Joe:** Exactly. And there's a growing push towards incorporating antibody validation into the research workflow. Journals are increasingly requiring authors to provide evidence of antibody validation, which is a positive step. 

**Sarah:** But let's be honest, Joe, some researchers might be tempted to cut corners if they feel pressured to publish quickly. How do we ensure that rigorous validation practices are actually followed?

**Joe:** It's a valid concern. That's why it's important to promote a culture of scientific integrity and collaboration. We need to create an environment where researchers feel supported and encouraged to prioritize accurate and reproducible research, even if it takes a bit longer. 

**Sarah:** I agree. And perhaps technology can play a role here too. Can you envision tools or platforms that could streamline the validation process and make it more accessible to researchers?

**Joe:** Absolutely. There are already some promising developments in this area. For example, companies like Abcam and Bio-Rad are developing automated systems for antibody validation. These tools could significantly reduce the time and effort required for researchers to validate their antibodies.

**Sarah:** That sounds promising! So, while there are still challenges to overcome, it seems like we're heading in the right direction. Do you think we'll ever reach a point where antibody reliability is no longer a major concern?

**Joe:** I believe we can. With continued efforts from researchers, journals, funding agencies, and technology developers, we can create a future where antibody-based research is consistently reliable and reproducible. This will ultimately lead to faster scientific progress, better healthcare outcomes, and a deeper understanding of human health and disease.

**Sarah:** That's a truly inspiring vision, Joe. I'm excited to see how this field continues to evolve and contribute to a brighter future for science and society.
