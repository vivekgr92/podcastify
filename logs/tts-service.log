Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that directly linked to unreliable antibodies?

Joe:  Um, yeah, it's a significant contributor.  You see, scientists rely heavily on antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  But, and this is a big but, many commercially available antibodies just don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein strongly enough, or worse, they bind to other proteins entirely, giving you completely false results.

Sarah:  So, false positives, basically?  That's... concerning. I mean, how many studies could be affected by this?

Joe:  Exactly.  It's incredibly concerning.  One study highlighted the case of a single antibody used in over fifteen papers, cited over 3000 times! And guess what?  That antibody didn't even bind to the intended protein.  It was completely useless for the purpose it was used in those papers.  Think of the wasted time, resources, and the potential for misleading conclusions... it's a huge problem.

Sarah:  Wow. That's... a shocking number.  So, what's being done to address this?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the antibody manufacturers?

Joe:  It's a multifaceted problem, so the solutions are multifaceted too.  Yes, better quality control from manufacturers is crucial. But it's not just that.  There's a growing movement towards open science initiatives, like iCharOS – that's pronounced "Icarus" –  which aims to systematically test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It’s a massive undertaking.

Sarah: That sounds like a Herculean task!  But incredibly important. So, are researchers just blindly trusting the manufacturers' claims now, or are there ways to verify the antibodies independently?

Joe:  Ah, that's a great question.  Ideally, researchers should always independently validate the antibodies they use.  But, um, that's often not done, or it's not done rigorously enough.  Part of the problem is the lack of readily available, well-characterized antibodies.  iCharOS and similar initiatives are trying to change that by providing a public database of validated antibodies.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of better manufacturing, better testing, and increased transparency and collaboration?

Joe: Exactly! It’s a systems problem that needs a systems solution.  It requires better standards, more rigorous testing, and a shift in the research culture towards greater scrutiny and sharing of data.  It’s a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like iCharOS are paving the way for more reliable research and, ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.

Sarah:  It's certainly a crucial step.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's much clearer now why this antibody issue is such a big deal.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.

It's certainly a crucial step.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's much clearer now why this antibody issue is such a big deal.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, you mentioned the YCharOS initiative and its impact on antibody validation.  It's a really significant effort, you know?  Their approach of comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – that's crucial for establishing specificity.  It directly addresses the problem of false positives, which, as we discussed earlier, can completely derail research.

Sarah:  Right.  But it makes me wonder,  how scalable is this method?  I mean, they've tested over a thousand antibodies, which is impressive, but there are millions on the market.  Is this kind of rigorous testing feasible for every single antibody?  And what about antibodies targeting less-studied proteins?  Would the availability of appropriate cell lines be a limiting factor?

Joe: That's a great point.  Scalability is definitely a challenge.  The process is labor-intensive, requiring careful cell culture, meticulous experimental design, and robust data analysis.  For less-studied proteins, finding suitable cell lines could indeed be difficult, potentially requiring the generation of new cell lines specifically for validation purposes. This adds another layer of complexity and cost.  And of course, the sheer number of antibodies is overwhelming.  It's not a simple matter of just scaling up the current process linearly.

Sarah:  So, what other approaches are there, then?  You mentioned OMAPs, which seems to tackle the problem from a different angle.

Joe:  Exactly. OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within specific applications, across different contexts.  Instead of aiming for universal validation, they concentrate on confirming performance within a defined set of experimental conditions – say, in various tissue types using a particular imaging technique. This is a more targeted approach, potentially more feasible for a larger scale, but it doesn't guarantee performance across the board.  It's a trade-off.

Sarah:  So it's like, YCharOS is aiming for broader, more fundamental validation, while OMAPs is more focused on application-specific validation?  Is that a fair summary?

Joe:  Yeah, pretty much.  YCharOS provides a strong foundation, showing whether the antibody binds to its intended target under controlled conditions.  OMAPs then builds upon that, validating performance in real-world applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation, but it’s a resource-intensive endeavor.

Sarah:  It's fascinating how these two approaches complement each other, almost like two sides of the same coin.  It really highlights the complexity of this issue and the need for multiple strategies to tackle it.  It sounds like a collaborative effort involving researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies is absolutely crucial.

Joe: Absolutely.  This isn't something any single group can solve on their own.  The scale of the problem demands a collaborative, multi-faceted approach.  And transparent data sharing, as YCharOS does, is critical to building trust and accelerating progress.  It's a bit of a messy problem, but the progress is encouraging.

And transparent data sharing, as YCharOS does, is critical to building trust and accelerating progress.  It's a bit of a messy problem, but the progress is encouraging.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: Okay, Joe, so we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned these RRIDs – Research Resource Identifiers –  to help track down antibodies. Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounds a bit… technical.

Joe:  Sure.  Think of it like this: every antibody, ideally, should have a unique ID number, like a barcode, that never changes.  Right now, companies often use their own catalog numbers, which can disappear if the company stops making that antibody, or even be duplicated by accident.  RRIDs are designed to be a permanent, universally recognized identifier for each antibody, regardless of the supplier. So, if someone publishes a paper using a specific antibody with its RRID, anyone else can easily find that exact same antibody years later, even if the original supplier is gone.  It's about creating a permanent record, you know?


Sarah:  So, it’s basically a standardized, persistent identifier to solve the problem of disappearing or duplicated catalog numbers.  That makes sense. But it sounds like even with RRIDs, identifying *good* antibodies is still a huge hurdle.  You mentioned CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies. How does that fit into the picture?

Joe:  Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but CiteAb helps you assess its quality. It's a database that compiles information on many antibodies, including citation counts.  The more a particular antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable. They're also starting to integrate data from YCharOS, which adds another layer of validation –  characterization data, showing exactly how the antibody performs.  It's not foolproof, of course.  But it provides researchers with much more information than they’ve had in the past to make informed decisions.

Sarah:  So, more data means better decisions.  But you also mentioned something about "knock-out validation." What's that?

Joe:  Knock-out validation is a very rigorous way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  Basically, you genetically modify cells to remove (knock out) the protein the antibody is supposed to detect.  If the antibody no longer binds to these modified cells, it confirms that it's specifically recognizing the target protein and not something else.  It's a gold standard, but unfortunately, very few antibodies have undergone this kind of validation.

Sarah:  It sounds incredibly thorough, but also, as you said, quite rare.  So, even with all these tools – RRIDs, CiteAb, and knock-out validation – we’re still far from a perfect solution, right?

Joe: Um, yeah.  It's a complex problem with no single, easy fix.  The good news is that there's a growing awareness of the issue and initiatives, like the Only Good Antibodies community, are bringing together stakeholders to work on solutions collaboratively.  It’s a messy, ongoing process, but progress is being made.  It's a bit like… well, maybe not like a puzzle, because that implies a neat solution.  It's more like…  a continuously evolving system needing constant refinement.

Sarah:  I think that’s a good way to put it.  A continuously evolving system.  It makes it clear that this isn’t a problem that will be solved overnight. Thanks, Joe, for explaining all that.

    "text": "Okay, Joe, so we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned these RRIDs – Research Resource Identifiers –  to help track down antibodies. Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounds a bit… technical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Sure.  Think of it like this: every antibody, ideally, should have a unique ID number, like a barcode, that never changes.  Right now, companies often use their own catalog numbers, which can disappear if the company stops making that antibody, or even be duplicated by accident.  RRIDs are designed to be a permanent, universally recognized identifier for each antibody, regardless of the supplier. So, if someone publishes a paper using a specific antibody with its RRID, anyone else can easily find that exact same antibody years later, even if the original supplier is gone.  It's about creating a permanent record, you know?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "So, it’s basically a standardized, persistent identifier to solve the problem of disappearing or duplicated catalog numbers.  That makes sense. But it sounds like even with RRIDs, identifying *good* antibodies is still a huge hurdle.  You mentioned CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies. How does that fit into the picture?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but CiteAb helps you assess its quality. It's a database that compiles information on many antibodies, including citation counts.  The more a particular antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable. They're also starting to integrate data from YCharOS, which adds another layer of validation –  characterization data, showing exactly how the antibody performs.  It's not foolproof, of course.  But it provides researchers with much more information than they’ve had in the past to make informed decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "So, more data means better decisions.  But you also mentioned something about \"knock-out validation.\" What's that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Knock-out validation is a very rigorous way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  Basically, you genetically modify cells to remove (knock out) the protein the antibody is supposed to detect.  If the antibody no longer binds to these modified cells, it confirms that it's specifically recognizing the target protein and not something else.  It's a gold standard, but unfortunately, very few antibodies have undergone this kind of validation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "It sounds incredibly thorough, but also, as you said, quite rare.  So, even with all these tools – RRIDs, CiteAb, and knock-out validation – we’re still far from a perfect solution, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Um, yeah.  It's a complex problem with no single, easy fix.  The good news is that there's a growing awareness of the issue and initiatives, like the Only Good Antibodies community, are bringing together stakeholders to work on solutions collaboratively.  It’s a messy, ongoing process, but progress is being made.  It's a bit like… well, maybe not like a puzzle, because that implies a neat solution.  It's more like…  a continuously evolving system needing constant refinement."

**Previous Context**:
I think that’s a good way to put it.  A continuously evolving system.  It makes it clear that this isn’t a problem that will be solved overnight. Thanks, Joe, for explaining all that.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Okay, so we’ve talked about the challenges with antibody reliability, and the move towards recombinant antibodies seems like a big part of the solution.  But, you know, the article mentions that changing scientist behavior is still a huge hurdle.  Can you explain why that is so difficult, Joe?

Joe:  Yeah, it's a complex issue.  It boils down to a few things. First, there's inertia.  Scientists, like anyone else, often stick with what they know and what works, even if it's not ideal.  If an antibody has yielded results in the past, there's a reluctance to switch, even if there's evidence suggesting it might not be perfectly specific or reliable.  It takes time and effort to validate a new antibody, and researchers are often under pressure to publish, so they might prioritize speed over rigorous validation.

Sarah:  So it's a time and resource issue, right?  They're juggling deadlines and funding…

Joe: Exactly.  And then there's the issue of trust.  Some scientists might be hesitant to trust new antibodies, especially if they've had bad experiences with unreliable ones in the past.  Building trust in the new recombinant antibodies and the validation processes is crucial.  It's not just about the technology; it's about changing a culture of reliance on established, even if imperfect, methods.

Sarah: That makes sense.  It sounds like a classic case of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, even if it’s subtly broken.  But the article also talks about rewards for using best practices.  How effective do you think that approach is?

Joe:  Well, incentives can definitely help. Offering grants or other forms of recognition for adopting best practices can encourage scientists to invest the time and resources needed for validation.  Think of it as a carrot, rather than a stick.  It’s not a guaranteed solution, though. Some researchers might still prioritize speed and familiar methods even with incentives.  The effectiveness depends on the size and nature of the reward, and how it's communicated.

Sarah:  So it's not a silver bullet, but a helpful tool in a larger strategy?

Joe:  Precisely. It's one piece of the puzzle.  You need a combination of things: improved antibody production methods, robust validation processes, readily available resources for validation, and, importantly, a change in the scientific culture to prioritize reliability over speed and familiarity.  It's a system-wide problem, and a system-wide solution is needed.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves, but the entire research workflow and the incentives surrounding it.

Sarah:  So, it's a continuously evolving system, as you mentioned earlier.  It sounds like a long-term project.

Joe:  Absolutely.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  But the progress reported in the article is encouraging.  The increased adoption of recombinant antibodies, the collaborative efforts of organizations like OGA, and the growing awareness of the issue among researchers all point towards a more reliable future for antibody-based research.  There’s still a long way to go, but there is progress.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** So, Joe, you were just outlining the ways researchers validate their antibodies.  That sounded… complicated.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation…  It’s a lot to take in. Can you break it down a bit more simply for our listeners?

**Joe:**  Sure, Sarah.  Let's start with the basics.  The goal is always the same:  to make sure the antibody actually binds to the specific protein we think it should, and nothing else.  We need to be certain it's not cross-reacting, you know, sticking to other proteins by mistake.

**Sarah:** Right, so it's like making sure your key only fits the right lock, not any other lock on the keyring?

**Joe:**  That's... not a bad analogy, actually.  But think of it more like this: we're trying to identify a specific molecule within a complex mixture.  Each technique offers a different way to do that. Immunohistochemistry, for example, is like looking at a tissue sample under a microscope.  If the antibody binds to the protein, those cells light up, essentially.  It gives a visual confirmation of where the protein is located within the tissue.

**Sarah:** Okay, so that's a visual check. What about the others?

**Joe:**  Western blotting is different.  It separates proteins by size, like sorting marbles by size.  Then, we add our antibody. If it binds to the protein of the expected size, we see a band on the blot, confirming the antibody's specificity.

**Sarah:** So, a size-based confirmation.  And immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** That's more like fishing. We use the antibody as bait, attached to tiny beads.  These beads grab the target protein out of a complex sample.  Then, we can analyze what we've caught using something called mass spectrometry, which identifies the protein's precise makeup. It’s a very powerful technique for confirmation.

**Sarah:**  So, each method offers a different kind of confirmation,  providing a more complete picture of the antibody's reliability.  It sounds like a lot of work! No wonder there's been so much emphasis on improving the process.

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  And it's not always straightforward.  Sometimes you get unexpected results, and you have to troubleshoot, repeat experiments, and refine your approach. It's a process of iterative refinement.

**Sarah:**  So, it's not just a case of "one and done"?

**Joe:**  Definitely not.  It's a rigorous process, and that's crucial for reliable scientific findings.  You really need to be confident in your reagents – which includes antibodies –  before you build any conclusions on top of them.

**Sarah:** That's incredibly important to remember.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. It makes the research process seem much more nuanced and challenging than I initially thought.


**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it today.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly valuable.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that directly linked to unreliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Um, yeah, it's a significant contributor.  You see, scientists rely heavily on antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  But, and this is a big but, many commercially available antibodies just don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein strongly enough, or worse, they bind to other proteins entirely, giving you completely false results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, false positives, basically?  That's... concerning. I mean, how many studies could be affected by this?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's incredibly concerning.  One study highlighted the case of a single antibody used in over fifteen papers, cited over 3000 times! And guess what?  That antibody didn't even bind to the intended protein.  It was completely useless for the purpose it was used in those papers.  Think of the wasted time, resources, and the potential for misleading conclusions... it's a huge problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. That's... a shocking number.  So, what's being done to address this?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the antibody manufacturers?
[INFO] Joe: It's a multifaceted problem, so the solutions are multifaceted too.  Yes, better quality control from manufacturers is crucial. But it's not just that.  There's a growing movement towards open science initiatives, like iCharOS – that's pronounced "Icarus" –  which aims to systematically test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It’s a massive undertaking.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a Herculean task!  But incredibly important. So, are researchers just blindly trusting the manufacturers' claims now, or are there ways to verify the antibodies independently?
[INFO] Joe: Ah, that's a great question.  Ideally, researchers should always independently validate the antibodies they use.  But, um, that's often not done, or it's not done rigorously enough.  Part of the problem is the lack of readily available, well-characterized antibodies.  iCharOS and similar initiatives are trying to change that by providing a public database of validated antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of better manufacturing, better testing, and increased transparency and collaboration?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly! It’s a systems problem that needs a systems solution.  It requires better standards, more rigorous testing, and a shift in the research culture towards greater scrutiny and sharing of data.  It’s a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like iCharOS are paving the way for more reliable research and, ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.
[INFO] Sarah: It's certainly a crucial step.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's much clearer now why this antibody issue is such a big deal.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, you mentioned the YCharOS initiative and its impact on antibody validation.  It's a really significant effort, you know?  Their approach of comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – that's crucial for establishing specificity.  It directly addresses the problem of false positives, which, as we discussed earlier, can completely derail research.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  But it makes me wonder,  how scalable is this method?  I mean, they've tested over a thousand antibodies, which is impressive, but there are millions on the market.  Is this kind of rigorous testing feasible for every single antibody?  And what about antibodies targeting less-studied proteins?  Would the availability of appropriate cell lines be a limiting factor?
[INFO] Joe: That's a great point.  Scalability is definitely a challenge.  The process is labor-intensive, requiring careful cell culture, meticulous experimental design, and robust data analysis.  For less-studied proteins, finding suitable cell lines could indeed be difficult, potentially requiring the generation of new cell lines specifically for validation purposes. This adds another layer of complexity and cost.  And of course, the sheer number of antibodies is overwhelming.  It's not a simple matter of just scaling up the current process linearly.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what other approaches are there, then?  You mentioned OMAPs, which seems to tackle the problem from a different angle.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within specific applications, across different contexts.  Instead of aiming for universal validation, they concentrate on confirming performance within a defined set of experimental conditions – say, in various tissue types using a particular imaging technique. This is a more targeted approach, potentially more feasible for a larger scale, but it doesn't guarantee performance across the board.  It's a trade-off.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's like, YCharOS is aiming for broader, more fundamental validation, while OMAPs is more focused on application-specific validation?  Is that a fair summary?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, pretty much.  YCharOS provides a strong foundation, showing whether the antibody binds to its intended target under controlled conditions.  OMAPs then builds upon that, validating performance in real-world applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation, but it’s a resource-intensive endeavor.
[INFO] Sarah: It's fascinating how these two approaches complement each other, almost like two sides of the same coin.  It really highlights the complexity of this issue and the need for multiple strategies to tackle it.  It sounds like a collaborative effort involving researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies is absolutely crucial.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  This isn't something any single group can solve on their own.  The scale of the problem demands a collaborative, multi-faceted approach.  And transparent data sharing, as YCharOS does, is critical to building trust and accelerating progress.  It's a bit of a messy problem, but the progress is encouraging.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, Joe, so we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned these RRIDs – Research Resource Identifiers –  to help track down antibodies. Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounds a bit… technical.
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Think of it like this: every antibody, ideally, should have a unique ID number, like a barcode, that never changes.  Right now, companies often use their own catalog numbers, which can disappear if the company stops making that antibody, or even be duplicated by accident.  RRIDs are designed to be a permanent, universally recognized identifier for each antibody, regardless of the supplier. So, if someone publishes a paper using a specific antibody with its RRID, anyone else can easily find that exact same antibody years later, even if the original supplier is gone.  It's about creating a permanent record, you know?
[INFO] Sarah: So, it’s basically a standardized, persistent identifier to solve the problem of disappearing or duplicated catalog numbers.  That makes sense. But it sounds like even with RRIDs, identifying *good* antibodies is still a huge hurdle.  You mentioned CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies. How does that fit into the picture?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but CiteAb helps you assess its quality. It's a database that compiles information on many antibodies, including citation counts.  The more a particular antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable. They're also starting to integrate data from YCharOS, which adds another layer of validation –  characterization data, showing exactly how the antibody performs.  It's not foolproof, of course.  But it provides researchers with much more information than they’ve had in the past to make informed decisions.
[INFO] Sarah: So, more data means better decisions.  But you also mentioned something about "knock-out validation." What's that?
[INFO] Joe: Knock-out validation is a very rigorous way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  Basically, you genetically modify cells to remove (knock out) the protein the antibody is supposed to detect.  If the antibody no longer binds to these modified cells, it confirms that it's specifically recognizing the target protein and not something else.  It's a gold standard, but unfortunately, very few antibodies have undergone this kind of validation.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds incredibly thorough, but also, as you said, quite rare.  So, even with all these tools – RRIDs, CiteAb, and knock-out validation – we’re still far from a perfect solution, right?
[INFO] Joe: Um, yeah.  It's a complex problem with no single, easy fix.  The good news is that there's a growing awareness of the issue and initiatives, like the Only Good Antibodies community, are bringing together stakeholders to work on solutions collaboratively.  It’s a messy, ongoing process, but progress is being made.  It's a bit like… well, maybe not like a puzzle, because that implies a neat solution.  It's more like…  a continuously evolving system needing constant refinement.
[INFO] Sarah: I think that’s a good way to put it.  A continuously evolving system.  It makes it clear that this isn’t a problem that will be solved overnight. Thanks, Joe, for explaining all that.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so we’ve talked about the challenges with antibody reliability, and the move towards recombinant antibodies seems like a big part of the solution.  But, you know, the article mentions that changing scientist behavior is still a huge hurdle.  Can you explain why that is so difficult, Joe?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a complex issue.  It boils down to a few things. First, there's inertia.  Scientists, like anyone else, often stick with what they know and what works, even if it's not ideal.  If an antibody has yielded results in the past, there's a reluctance to switch, even if there's evidence suggesting it might not be perfectly specific or reliable.  It takes time and effort to validate a new antibody, and researchers are often under pressure to publish, so they might prioritize speed over rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's a time and resource issue, right?  They're juggling deadlines and funding…
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  And then there's the issue of trust.  Some scientists might be hesitant to trust new antibodies, especially if they've had bad experiences with unreliable ones in the past.  Building trust in the new recombinant antibodies and the validation processes is crucial.  It's not just about the technology; it's about changing a culture of reliance on established, even if imperfect, methods.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes sense.  It sounds like a classic case of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, even if it’s subtly broken.  But the article also talks about rewards for using best practices.  How effective do you think that approach is?
[INFO] Joe: Well, incentives can definitely help. Offering grants or other forms of recognition for adopting best practices can encourage scientists to invest the time and resources needed for validation.  Think of it as a carrot, rather than a stick.  It’s not a guaranteed solution, though. Some researchers might still prioritize speed and familiar methods even with incentives.  The effectiveness depends on the size and nature of the reward, and how it's communicated.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's not a silver bullet, but a helpful tool in a larger strategy?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely. It's one piece of the puzzle.  You need a combination of things: improved antibody production methods, robust validation processes, readily available resources for validation, and, importantly, a change in the scientific culture to prioritize reliability over speed and familiarity.  It's a system-wide problem, and a system-wide solution is needed.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves, but the entire research workflow and the incentives surrounding it.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a continuously evolving system, as you mentioned earlier.  It sounds like a long-term project.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  But the progress reported in the article is encouraging.  The increased adoption of recombinant antibodies, the collaborative efforts of organizations like OGA, and the growing awareness of the issue among researchers all point towards a more reliable future for antibody-based research.  There’s still a long way to go, but there is progress.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, you were just outlining the ways researchers validate their antibodies.  That sounded… complicated.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation…  It’s a lot to take in. Can you break it down a bit more simply for our listeners?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure, Sarah.  Let's start with the basics.  The goal is always the same:  to make sure the antibody actually binds to the specific protein we think it should, and nothing else.  We need to be certain it's not cross-reacting, you know, sticking to other proteins by mistake.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Right, so it's like making sure your key only fits the right lock, not any other lock on the keyring?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's... not a bad analogy, actually.  But think of it more like this: we're trying to identify a specific molecule within a complex mixture.  Each technique offers a different way to do that. Immunohistochemistry, for example, is like looking at a tissue sample under a microscope.  If the antibody binds to the protein, those cells light up, essentially.  It gives a visual confirmation of where the protein is located within the tissue.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, so that's a visual check. What about the others?
[INFO] Joe: **  Western blotting is different.  It separates proteins by size, like sorting marbles by size.  Then, we add our antibody. If it binds to the protein of the expected size, we see a band on the blot, confirming the antibody's specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, a size-based confirmation.  And immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's more like fishing. We use the antibody as bait, attached to tiny beads.  These beads grab the target protein out of a complex sample.  Then, we can analyze what we've caught using something called mass spectrometry, which identifies the protein's precise makeup. It’s a very powerful technique for confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, each method offers a different kind of confirmation,  providing a more complete picture of the antibody's reliability.  It sounds like a lot of work! No wonder there's been so much emphasis on improving the process.
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  And it's not always straightforward.  Sometimes you get unexpected results, and you have to troubleshoot, repeat experiments, and refine your approach. It's a process of iterative refinement.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's not just a case of "one and done"?
[INFO] Joe: **  Definitely not.  It's a rigorous process, and that's crucial for reliable scientific findings.  You really need to be confident in your reagents – which includes antibodies –  before you build any conclusions on top of them.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's incredibly important to remember.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. It makes the research process seem much more nuanced and challenging than I initially thought.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it today.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Absolutely.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly valuable.
