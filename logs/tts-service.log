Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, today we're diving into a really fascinating story about antibodies – or rather, the *problems* with antibodies in scientific research.  It's a bigger deal than you might think.  Carl Laflamme,  um, he was studying this protein linked to motor neuron disease, right?  He knew *which* protein, the one encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, but finding it… that was the challenge.

Sarah:  Right. So, he was looking for this specific protein, but the problem wasn't finding the gene, it was actually finding the protein itself, using the tools available?

Joe: Exactly!  He looked at the existing literature and, uh, it was a mess.  Papers couldn't agree on where this protein even *was* in the cell.  There was a lot of conflicting data.  He suspected the problem might lie with the antibodies researchers were using. You know, antibodies are these molecules that scientists use to, um, to basically tag and identify specific proteins within a cell.  They're essential tools.

Sarah:  So, like a little molecular label?  To find the protein you're looking for amongst all the others?

Joe:  Yeah, something like that. But the issue is, many commercially available antibodies, the ones scientists buy and use, just don’t work reliably. They might bind to the *wrong* things, giving you false results.  Laflamme tested sixteen different commercial antibodies advertised as binding to this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly.

Sarah:  Wow, that's a pretty low success rate.  So, fifteen out of sixteen were essentially useless?  And this was impacting research on a disease like ALS?

Joe:  Yeah, it's shocking. And even worse,  one of the poorly performing antibodies – the one that didn't even bind to the target protein – had been used in about fifteen published studies, cited over 3,000 times!  That’s a huge problem for the reliability of scientific research.  It highlights a reproducibility crisis in the field.  Think about all the time, money, and effort wasted on research based on faulty tools.

Sarah:  That’s incredibly frustrating. So, what's being done to fix this?  Is it just about better quality control for antibody manufacturers?

Joe: It's a multifaceted problem, so it needs a multifaceted solution. Laflamme, along with Aled Edwards, started an initiative called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science – to systematically test commercially available antibodies for every human protein. There are other efforts too: improving antibody production, making it easier to find reliable antibodies, and promoting best practices in how researchers use them. It's a huge undertaking, but hopefully, it will lead to more reliable research overall.

Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task, but definitely a necessary one.  Thanks Joe, this is a really eye-opening look at the challenges facing scientific research.  We'll have to come back and discuss some of these solutions in more detail in a future episode.

Joe: Absolutely, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but definitely worth unpacking further. Thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey, everyone!

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is fascinating, isn’t it?  It really highlights a major problem in the field – the unreliability of commercially available antibodies.  Seven point seven million products... that's a staggering number, and a huge potential for inconsistencies.

Sarah:  Exactly!  And it's not just a minor issue.  It directly impacts the validity of research findings, right?  I mean, if your antibody isn't specific to the target protein, your whole experiment could be flawed.  It's like building a house on a shaky foundation.  But I'm curious, what's the technical basis for their testing method?  You mentioned knock-out cell lines...

Joe:  Right.  Their approach is pretty straightforward.  They compare antibody performance in two cell lines: one that *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein is present – and a "knock-out" line where that specific protein is genetically absent, you know, essentially deleted.  By comparing binding in both lines, they can directly assess the antibody's specificity.  If the antibody binds strongly to the target protein in the normal cell line but shows minimal binding in the knock-out cell line, that's a good indication of specificity.  It's a pretty fundamental test, but incredibly important.

Sarah: So, it's a direct comparison of binding affinity, essentially?  No fancy techniques or indirect measurements involved?

Joe:  Precisely.  It’s a relatively simple, but powerful, method.  The elegance lies in its directness.  Eliminating the target protein provides a very clear negative control.  Many previous methods relied on indirect measures, leading to more ambiguity.

Sarah: That makes perfect sense.  It's a control group, but at the cellular level. Clever.  But even with this rigorous testing,  the article mentioned that context matters – the antibodies might behave differently depending on the tissue or protocol used.  How can that be addressed?

Joe: That’s a really important point.  YCharOS focuses on a specific context,  but as Cecilia Williams pointed out, researchers use antibodies in many different ways.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in.  They're looking at a single application – multiplex imaging – but across various contexts, different tissues and imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach.

Sarah:  So, YCharOS is like a quality control check for the antibody itself, while OMAPs tests its performance in different applications.  A two-pronged approach, if you will.  It seems like a collaborative effort is key to addressing this massive problem.

Joe: Absolutely.  The scale of the problem necessitates collaboration.  Both initiatives highlight the power of community involvement and open data sharing. Getting manufacturers involved, having open access to results... it’s crucial for progress.

Sarah:  It's a great example of how scientists are tackling a systemic issue through innovative approaches and collaboration.  And it emphasizes the importance of basic, yet rigorous, scientific methods.  Thanks for explaining that so clearly, Joe.  This was really helpful.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: Wow, Joe, that's a lot to unpack.  So, we've got this problem with antibodies –  they're not always what they seem, right?  And this is impacting the reproducibility of research.  But you mentioned RRIDs –  research resource identifiers. Can you explain that again in a bit more detail?  What exactly *are* they?

Joe:  Sure.  Think of RRIDs as unique ID numbers for research resources, like specific antibodies.  Um...  currently, a lot of antibodies are identified by catalogue numbers assigned by manufacturers. The problem is, these numbers can change or disappear if the manufacturer stops making the antibody, or even worse, different manufacturers might use the same number for different antibodies.  RRIDs are designed to be permanent and unique, regardless of the manufacturer.  It's like a permanent, globally recognized address for each antibody.

Sarah: Okay, so it's like a universal product code, but specifically for research materials. That makes sense.  But even with these unique identifiers, it sounds like we still have a problem with knowing *if* an antibody is actually any good, right?  I mean, even if I can find the antibody, how do I know it's reliable?

Joe: Exactly.  That's where platforms like CiteAb come in.  They're essentially search engines for antibodies, and they're trying to compile information about how well-cited and validated different antibodies are.  So, you can see how often an antibody has been used in published research, and ideally, whether it's been independently verified to actually do what it's supposed to do.  But, and this is a big but,  even CiteAb doesn’t have complete validation data for every antibody.  It’s a work in progress.

Sarah: So, it's a bit like Yelp for antibodies, but instead of reviews, you're looking at citation counts and validation studies.  And it's still not perfect...  You mentioned something about knock-out validation. What's that?

Joe: Knock-out validation is a rigorous way to test an antibody.  Basically, you genetically modify an organism to remove the protein the antibody is supposed to target. If the antibody no longer detects anything in the modified organism, it confirms that the antibody specifically binds to the target protein. It's a pretty strong indicator of reliability.  But, like you said, it's not always done.

Sarah:  So, it's like a gold standard but very few antibodies have actually gone through that process.  This whole thing sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.  This Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community... what's their approach?

Joe:  Yeah, it is frustrating.  OGA is trying a different tack.  They're bringing together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to work collaboratively on the problem.  They're trying to create a more systemic solution, rather than just relying on individual researchers to figure it out on their own.  It's a much broader, collaborative effort to improve the whole system.

Sarah: So, a multi-pronged approach.  Addressing the problem through better identification, better validation, and more importantly, better collaboration between all the players involved.  That sounds like a much-needed step. Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: So, Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies and reproducibility.  One thing that stood out was this shift towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain why that's such a big deal?

Joe:  Right, so recombinant antibodies are produced using genetically engineered cells.  Think of it like this – instead of relying on the unpredictable immune response of an animal, you’re essentially programming a cell to produce a *specific* antibody.  This makes the production process much more consistent.  The older methods, using immune cells, often resulted in batches of antibodies with varying properties, leading to inconsistencies in research results.  Recombinant methods, because they're based on a controlled genetic process, yield much more uniform antibodies.  This uniformity is key for reproducibility.

Sarah:  Okay, so more consistent product, leading to more reliable results.  But the article mentioned that even with these improvements, changing scientist behavior is a major hurdle. Why is that?

Joe:  Yeah, that's a huge challenge.  Scientists, you know, might have been using a particular antibody for years, and they've gotten results they're happy with.  Even if there's evidence that the antibody isn't perfectly specific or reliable, there's inertia.  They might not want to switch, even if a recombinant version is available and demonstrably better. It's a combination of factors – time constraints, familiarity with existing methods, and maybe even a reluctance to change established workflows.  It’s not necessarily resistance; it's often just practical considerations.

Sarah:  So it’s not necessarily malicious, more like a sort of… inertia?

Joe: Exactly.  And, frankly, validating antibodies is time-consuming and resource-intensive.  It requires extra experiments and effort.  So there's a push and pull between wanting reliable results and the practical realities of doing the research.

Sarah:  It sounds like a systemic problem, then.  Not just individual researchers but also the way funding and publishing work... impacting the incentives.

Joe:  Absolutely.  The article touched on this – the need for incentives to encourage researchers to adopt best practices.  If there are grants or publishing advantages for using validated, preferably recombinant, antibodies, you'll see a faster shift in behavior.  It's not just about the technology; it's about the entire research ecosystem.  It's a multi-pronged problem requiring a multi-pronged solution.  We need better tools, better practices, and better incentives to get everyone on board.

Sarah:  So, in short, it's a complex problem with no easy fix, but the move towards recombinant antibodies and the initiatives described are definitely steps in the right direction.  Thanks for breaking it down for us, Joe.  This has been really helpful.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah:  So, Joe, you mentioned several ways researchers validate antibodies.  Um,  immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Can you just… walk me through those again, but maybe a little slower this time?  I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all.

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  No problem.  Let's start with immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you've got a sample of cells, right?  And you're trying to see if a specific protein is present in those cells. So, you use an antibody – which is like a tiny, highly specific targeting missile – that's designed to bind only to that protein. If the protein is there, the antibody sticks to it. Then, you use a method to visualize where the antibody has bound, showing you where the protein is located within the cells.  It's like… highlighting the protein.

Sarah:  Okay, so it's like staining, but with a really precise stain?

Joe:  Exactly.  Very precise.  Now, Western blotting is a bit different. This time, you're looking for a specific protein in a mixture of proteins. You separate all the proteins by size using gel electrophoresis – think of it like sorting marbles by size – and then you use the antibody to detect your target protein.  If the antibody binds, you see a band at a specific location on the gel, corresponding to the protein's molecular weight.  It's a way to confirm both the presence and size of the protein.

Sarah:  So, you're essentially confirming the identity of the protein based on its size and the antibody binding to it. That makes more sense now.  And immunoprecipitation?

Joe:  Right.  Immunoprecipitation is a bit more involved. You use the antibody – again, that specific targeting missile – to grab your protein of interest out of a complex mixture.  The antibody is often attached to tiny beads, so it's like using a tiny magnet to fish out your specific protein.  Once you've got it isolated, you can then use other methods, like mass spectrometry, to confirm its identity.  It's a more powerful technique for isolating a specific protein from a complex mixture.

Sarah: So, each method offers a different way to verify that the antibody is working as expected, and that it's targeting the right protein?

Joe: Precisely. They offer different levels of information and are often used in combination to build confidence in the results. You know, it's about building up evidence.  It's rarely a case of just one test being enough.

Sarah:  That's reassuring to hear.  It sounds like there are a lot of checks and balances in place, even if it's not perfect.  So... I guess that's why this whole antibody thing is so complicated.

Joe:  Exactly.  It's a complex process, and there's always room for improvement. But the techniques we've discussed are crucial for ensuring the reliability of antibody-based research.

Sarah:  This has been incredibly helpful, Joe. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It's always good to discuss this stuff.  Hopefully, it's made it a little clearer.

Sarah: Definitely!

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, today we're diving into a really fascinating story about antibodies – or rather, the *problems* with antibodies in scientific research.  It's a bigger deal than you might think.  Carl Laflamme,  um, he was studying this protein linked to motor neuron disease, right?  He knew *which* protein, the one encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, but finding it… that was the challenge.
[INFO] Sarah: Right. So, he was looking for this specific protein, but the problem wasn't finding the gene, it was actually finding the protein itself, using the tools available?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  He looked at the existing literature and, uh, it was a mess.  Papers couldn't agree on where this protein even *was* in the cell.  There was a lot of conflicting data.  He suspected the problem might lie with the antibodies researchers were using. You know, antibodies are these molecules that scientists use to, um, to basically tag and identify specific proteins within a cell.  They're essential tools.
[INFO] Sarah: So, like a little molecular label?  To find the protein you're looking for amongst all the others?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, something like that. But the issue is, many commercially available antibodies, the ones scientists buy and use, just don’t work reliably. They might bind to the *wrong* things, giving you false results.  Laflamme tested sixteen different commercial antibodies advertised as binding to this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a pretty low success rate.  So, fifteen out of sixteen were essentially useless?  And this was impacting research on a disease like ALS?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's shocking. And even worse,  one of the poorly performing antibodies – the one that didn't even bind to the target protein – had been used in about fifteen published studies, cited over 3,000 times!  That’s a huge problem for the reliability of scientific research.  It highlights a reproducibility crisis in the field.  Think about all the time, money, and effort wasted on research based on faulty tools.
[INFO] Sarah: That’s incredibly frustrating. So, what's being done to fix this?  Is it just about better quality control for antibody manufacturers?
[INFO] Joe: It's a multifaceted problem, so it needs a multifaceted solution. Laflamme, along with Aled Edwards, started an initiative called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science – to systematically test commercially available antibodies for every human protein. There are other efforts too: improving antibody production, making it easier to find reliable antibodies, and promoting best practices in how researchers use them. It's a huge undertaking, but hopefully, it will lead to more reliable research overall.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task, but definitely a necessary one.  Thanks Joe, this is a really eye-opening look at the challenges facing scientific research.  We'll have to come back and discuss some of these solutions in more detail in a future episode.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but definitely worth unpacking further. Thanks for joining us on Science Odyssey, everyone!
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is fascinating, isn’t it?  It really highlights a major problem in the field – the unreliability of commercially available antibodies.  Seven point seven million products... that's a staggering number, and a huge potential for inconsistencies.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly!  And it's not just a minor issue.  It directly impacts the validity of research findings, right?  I mean, if your antibody isn't specific to the target protein, your whole experiment could be flawed.  It's like building a house on a shaky foundation.  But I'm curious, what's the technical basis for their testing method?  You mentioned knock-out cell lines...
[INFO] Joe: Right.  Their approach is pretty straightforward.  They compare antibody performance in two cell lines: one that *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein is present – and a "knock-out" line where that specific protein is genetically absent, you know, essentially deleted.  By comparing binding in both lines, they can directly assess the antibody's specificity.  If the antibody binds strongly to the target protein in the normal cell line but shows minimal binding in the knock-out cell line, that's a good indication of specificity.  It's a pretty fundamental test, but incredibly important.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a direct comparison of binding affinity, essentially?  No fancy techniques or indirect measurements involved?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  It’s a relatively simple, but powerful, method.  The elegance lies in its directness.  Eliminating the target protein provides a very clear negative control.  Many previous methods relied on indirect measures, leading to more ambiguity.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes perfect sense.  It's a control group, but at the cellular level. Clever.  But even with this rigorous testing,  the article mentioned that context matters – the antibodies might behave differently depending on the tissue or protocol used.  How can that be addressed?
[INFO] Joe: That’s a really important point.  YCharOS focuses on a specific context,  but as Cecilia Williams pointed out, researchers use antibodies in many different ways.  That's where initiatives like OMAPs come in.  They're looking at a single application – multiplex imaging – but across various contexts, different tissues and imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach.
[INFO] Sarah: So, YCharOS is like a quality control check for the antibody itself, while OMAPs tests its performance in different applications.  A two-pronged approach, if you will.  It seems like a collaborative effort is key to addressing this massive problem.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  The scale of the problem necessitates collaboration.  Both initiatives highlight the power of community involvement and open data sharing. Getting manufacturers involved, having open access to results... it’s crucial for progress.
[INFO] Sarah: It's a great example of how scientists are tackling a systemic issue through innovative approaches and collaboration.  And it emphasizes the importance of basic, yet rigorous, scientific methods.  Thanks for explaining that so clearly, Joe.  This was really helpful.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, Joe, that's a lot to unpack.  So, we've got this problem with antibodies –  they're not always what they seem, right?  And this is impacting the reproducibility of research.  But you mentioned RRIDs –  research resource identifiers. Can you explain that again in a bit more detail?  What exactly *are* they?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Think of RRIDs as unique ID numbers for research resources, like specific antibodies.  Um...  currently, a lot of antibodies are identified by catalogue numbers assigned by manufacturers. The problem is, these numbers can change or disappear if the manufacturer stops making the antibody, or even worse, different manufacturers might use the same number for different antibodies.  RRIDs are designed to be permanent and unique, regardless of the manufacturer.  It's like a permanent, globally recognized address for each antibody.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like a universal product code, but specifically for research materials. That makes sense.  But even with these unique identifiers, it sounds like we still have a problem with knowing *if* an antibody is actually any good, right?  I mean, even if I can find the antibody, how do I know it's reliable?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  That's where platforms like CiteAb come in.  They're essentially search engines for antibodies, and they're trying to compile information about how well-cited and validated different antibodies are.  So, you can see how often an antibody has been used in published research, and ideally, whether it's been independently verified to actually do what it's supposed to do.  But, and this is a big but,  even CiteAb doesn’t have complete validation data for every antibody.  It’s a work in progress.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a bit like Yelp for antibodies, but instead of reviews, you're looking at citation counts and validation studies.  And it's still not perfect...  You mentioned something about knock-out validation. What's that?
[INFO] Joe: Knock-out validation is a rigorous way to test an antibody.  Basically, you genetically modify an organism to remove the protein the antibody is supposed to target. If the antibody no longer detects anything in the modified organism, it confirms that the antibody specifically binds to the target protein. It's a pretty strong indicator of reliability.  But, like you said, it's not always done.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like a gold standard but very few antibodies have actually gone through that process.  This whole thing sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.  This Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community... what's their approach?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it is frustrating.  OGA is trying a different tack.  They're bringing together all the stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to work collaboratively on the problem.  They're trying to create a more systemic solution, rather than just relying on individual researchers to figure it out on their own.  It's a much broader, collaborative effort to improve the whole system.
[INFO] Sarah: So, a multi-pronged approach.  Addressing the problem through better identification, better validation, and more importantly, better collaboration between all the players involved.  That sounds like a much-needed step. Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, that was a lot of information about antibodies and reproducibility.  One thing that stood out was this shift towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain why that's such a big deal?
[INFO] Joe: Right, so recombinant antibodies are produced using genetically engineered cells.  Think of it like this – instead of relying on the unpredictable immune response of an animal, you’re essentially programming a cell to produce a *specific* antibody.  This makes the production process much more consistent.  The older methods, using immune cells, often resulted in batches of antibodies with varying properties, leading to inconsistencies in research results.  Recombinant methods, because they're based on a controlled genetic process, yield much more uniform antibodies.  This uniformity is key for reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so more consistent product, leading to more reliable results.  But the article mentioned that even with these improvements, changing scientist behavior is a major hurdle. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's a huge challenge.  Scientists, you know, might have been using a particular antibody for years, and they've gotten results they're happy with.  Even if there's evidence that the antibody isn't perfectly specific or reliable, there's inertia.  They might not want to switch, even if a recombinant version is available and demonstrably better. It's a combination of factors – time constraints, familiarity with existing methods, and maybe even a reluctance to change established workflows.  It’s not necessarily resistance; it's often just practical considerations.
[INFO] Sarah: So it’s not necessarily malicious, more like a sort of… inertia?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  And, frankly, validating antibodies is time-consuming and resource-intensive.  It requires extra experiments and effort.  So there's a push and pull between wanting reliable results and the practical realities of doing the research.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a systemic problem, then.  Not just individual researchers but also the way funding and publishing work... impacting the incentives.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  The article touched on this – the need for incentives to encourage researchers to adopt best practices.  If there are grants or publishing advantages for using validated, preferably recombinant, antibodies, you'll see a faster shift in behavior.  It's not just about the technology; it's about the entire research ecosystem.  It's a multi-pronged problem requiring a multi-pronged solution.  We need better tools, better practices, and better incentives to get everyone on board.
[INFO] Sarah: So, in short, it's a complex problem with no easy fix, but the move towards recombinant antibodies and the initiatives described are definitely steps in the right direction.  Thanks for breaking it down for us, Joe.  This has been really helpful.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you mentioned several ways researchers validate antibodies.  Um,  immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Can you just… walk me through those again, but maybe a little slower this time?  I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all.
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  No problem.  Let's start with immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you've got a sample of cells, right?  And you're trying to see if a specific protein is present in those cells. So, you use an antibody – which is like a tiny, highly specific targeting missile – that's designed to bind only to that protein. If the protein is there, the antibody sticks to it. Then, you use a method to visualize where the antibody has bound, showing you where the protein is located within the cells.  It's like… highlighting the protein.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like staining, but with a really precise stain?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Very precise.  Now, Western blotting is a bit different. This time, you're looking for a specific protein in a mixture of proteins. You separate all the proteins by size using gel electrophoresis – think of it like sorting marbles by size – and then you use the antibody to detect your target protein.  If the antibody binds, you see a band at a specific location on the gel, corresponding to the protein's molecular weight.  It's a way to confirm both the presence and size of the protein.
[INFO] Sarah: So, you're essentially confirming the identity of the protein based on its size and the antibody binding to it. That makes more sense now.  And immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: Right.  Immunoprecipitation is a bit more involved. You use the antibody – again, that specific targeting missile – to grab your protein of interest out of a complex mixture.  The antibody is often attached to tiny beads, so it's like using a tiny magnet to fish out your specific protein.  Once you've got it isolated, you can then use other methods, like mass spectrometry, to confirm its identity.  It's a more powerful technique for isolating a specific protein from a complex mixture.
[INFO] Sarah: So, each method offers a different way to verify that the antibody is working as expected, and that it's targeting the right protein?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely. They offer different levels of information and are often used in combination to build confidence in the results. You know, it's about building up evidence.  It's rarely a case of just one test being enough.
[INFO] Sarah: That's reassuring to hear.  It sounds like there are a lot of checks and balances in place, even if it's not perfect.  So... I guess that's why this whole antibody thing is so complicated.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a complex process, and there's always room for improvement. But the techniques we've discussed are crucial for ensuring the reliability of antibody-based research.
[INFO] Sarah: This has been incredibly helpful, Joe. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's always good to discuss this stuff.  Hopefully, it's made it a little clearer.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific studies.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis...it's a big deal, right?  I mean, if the fundamental tools we're using aren't reliable, how can we trust the results?

Joe: Exactly.  Um, the problem is huge.  Take, for example, the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying this protein, you know, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, which is implicated in motor neuron disease.  He needed antibodies to, uh, to locate and quantify this protein within cells.  But...he found a real mess.  He looked at sixteen commercially available antibodies, all supposedly targeting this same protein, and only three actually worked properly.  Three out of sixteen!

Sarah: Wow.  That's...a pretty low success rate.  So, what makes an antibody "work properly"?  I mean, what are we even looking for here?

Joe:  Right. So, an antibody needs two key things: specificity and selectivity. Specificity means it strongly binds *only* to the target protein.  Selectivity means it doesn't bind to other proteins in the cell.  It's like, um, a really precise lock and key.  If the key (the antibody) fits only one lock (the target protein), and doesn’t accidentally open other locks, it's a good antibody.  If it's binding all over the place, it's useless, and potentially misleading.

Sarah: So, these poorly performing antibodies – they're essentially giving scientists false information?  Leading them down the wrong path?

Joe:  Precisely.  And Laflamme found that one particular antibody, which didn't even bind to the correct protein, had been used in about fifteen published studies – cited over 3,000 times! Think about the wasted time, resources, and potentially, the incorrect conclusions drawn from those studies. It's a huge problem.  This isn't just one isolated incident, either.  This is a systemic issue plaguing the field.

Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?

Joe:  There is hope!  There are several initiatives springing up to address this.  One is called iCharOS – that's "Icarus" –  a project aiming to characterize every commercially available antibody for human proteins.  They're systematically testing them to see which ones actually work.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production, make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones, and to just generally improve best practices in antibody selection and use.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funders, and publishers.

Sarah:  It sounds like a long and difficult road to fixing this, but it's definitely necessary. Thanks for explaining this, Joe. I think a lot of listeners will find this incredibly important and eye-opening.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology in research.

Joe: Absolutely, Sarah.  And it shows how even the most fundamental tools in our scientific toolkit can sometimes let us down.  It's a reminder that constant vigilance and critical assessment are crucial for reliable scientific progress.

Absolutely, Sarah.  And it shows how even the most fundamental tools in our scientific toolkit can sometimes let us down.  It's a reminder that constant vigilance and critical assessment are crucial for reliable scientific progress.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe:  Right, so Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is fascinating.  It highlights a critical issue – the unreliability of commercially available antibodies.  What’s striking is the sheer scale of the problem;  millions of antibodies on the market, a significant portion of which, according to their findings, don't perform as advertised.  The methodology they employ, comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein, is pretty straightforward, you know?  It’s a basic control, but incredibly important.  The lack of such rigorous testing is, frankly, shocking.


Sarah:  It is shocking, Joe.  And it speaks to a system-wide problem, doesn't it?  I mean, you've got these massive catalogs, these companies producing antibodies on a huge scale.  There's a real incentive to sell, right?  To get those products out there, even if the testing isn't as thorough as it should be.  But YCharOS's collaborative approach, getting buy-in from the manufacturers themselves, that's pretty innovative.  It's almost a self-regulating mechanism, isn't it?  Though, even with their efforts, it sounds like it’s still a drop in the ocean.  They’ve tested a thousand, but there are millions out there.


Joe:  Exactly.  It's a significant undertaking, but it’s also a limited scope.  They're focusing on a specific set of applications and cell types.  The point Cecilia Williams makes about context is crucial.  An antibody might perform flawlessly in one setting but completely fail in another, due to things like different tissue environments or experimental protocols.  That’s where initiatives like OMAPs come in, looking at the same antibodies across various contexts.  It's almost like two sides of the same coin; YCharOS provides rigorous characterization under specific conditions, while OMAPs focuses on validating performance across diverse contexts.


Sarah:  So, it's not just about the antibody itself, but also the environment in which it's used?  It's a complex interplay of factors.  And that makes it even more challenging to guarantee reliability, doesn’t it?  It's almost like... um...  think of it like a key and a lock, but the lock's design can change depending on the circumstances.  A key that works perfectly in one lock might not work at all in another slightly different lock.


Joe:  (chuckles)  I see what you mean.  While that analogy works on a surface level, it simplifies a highly intricate biological reality.  The interaction between an antibody and its target is far more nuanced than a simple key-lock system.  Factors such as post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and the presence of other molecules in the cellular environment all play a significant role.  But your point about the complexity and the need for multiple layers of validation is entirely correct.  Both YCharOS and OMAPs represent valuable, yet complementary, approaches to addressing this critical issue.  One's not a replacement for the other; they're both needed.


Sarah:  So, essentially, we need a multi-pronged approach to ensure antibody reliability.  It's not a quick fix, and it requires substantial collaboration between researchers, manufacturers, and funding bodies.  It’s a bit daunting, but incredibly important work.

So, essentially, we need a multi-pronged approach to ensure antibody reliability.  It's not a quick fix, and it requires substantial collaboration between researchers, manufacturers, and funding bodies.  It’s a bit daunting, but incredibly important work.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the need for reliable antibodies, and the sheer scale of the problem.  But you mentioned these RRIDs – research resource identifiers –  can you explain how they actually help?  It sounds a bit like a cataloging system, but for science?

Joe: Yeah, exactly.  It's like a global, persistent barcode for antibodies, and other research resources.  Think of it this way... um,  well, forget the analogy.  Basically,  a catalogue number from a company might disappear if the company stops making the antibody, or two different companies might accidentally use the same number.  RRIDs are unique and permanent identifiers,  so researchers can always find the *exact* antibody used in a published study, regardless of whether the original supplier still exists.  It's a crucial step towards reproducibility.

Sarah:  Okay, so that addresses the "finding" problem.  But what about the "trust" problem?  How do we know an antibody actually *works* as it's supposed to?

Joe: That's the much harder part.  The article mentions CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies, which is helpful, you know, because it shows how often an antibody's been cited.  High citation counts suggest it’s been used a lot, implying a degree of trust, but it doesn't guarantee quality.  Then there's the validation issue.  The gold standard is what they call "knock-out validation,"  where you show the antibody only binds to the target protein when that protein is present, and not when it's absent.  But, and this is a big but,  less than 5% of antibodies have this kind of validation.  It's a massive problem.

Sarah:  So, citation counts are a weak indicator at best, and proper validation is rare.  It sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.  This whole thing makes me wonder, are there any initiatives trying to directly address the validation issue?  Beyond just creating identifiers.

Joe: Absolutely.  The article mentions the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community.  They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – the whole ecosystem, really – to collaborate on solutions.  It’s a multi-pronged approach, like we discussed earlier.  They're trying to establish better standards for validation, encourage manufacturers to provide more comprehensive data, and work with journals to require better antibody reporting.  It's a long-term project,  a huge undertaking, but it's a necessary one.

Sarah:  It sounds like it is. It's a bit overwhelming to think about how many factors contribute to this problem, and how much coordinated effort it takes to fix it.  But hopefully, initiatives like OGA are making a real difference.  So, if a researcher is starting a new project today, what's the single most important thing they should do to ensure they're using reliable antibodies?

Joe: Hmm, that's a tough one.  There isn't one single magic bullet. But prioritizing antibodies with strong validation data, using resources like CiteAb to check citation counts and available validation information, and always making sure to record the RRID – that's a pretty good starting point.  It's about being as diligent as possible, and acknowledging that it's an ongoing challenge.  It's not just about the antibody itself, but the entire process of selecting, using, and reporting on it.

Sarah:  Right, it's a systems problem. Thanks, Joe.  That was really insightful.

Right, it's a systems problem. Thanks, Joe.  That was really insightful.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Okay, so we've talked about the systemic issues with antibody reliability.  But you mentioned earlier that it's not *just* a systems problem.  What other factors are at play here?  I mean, scientists are using these antibodies, right?  What's their role in this whole mess?

Joe:  Right, it's a multifaceted problem. The systemic issues – like lack of standardization and poor data sharing – are huge,  but the researcher's behavior is a significant piece of the puzzle, you know?  It's not just about the antibodies themselves.  A lot of it boils down to inertia and, frankly, sometimes resistance to change.

Sarah: Resistance to change?  Can you elaborate on that?

Joe: Sure.  Some researchers have been using certain antibodies for years. They've gotten results, even if those results might not be entirely reliable due to the antibody's limitations.  They've built their research around these antibodies, and the idea of switching, validating, or even just acknowledging potential flaws, is... disruptive. It takes time and effort, and it can mean redoing experiments.  It's understandable, to a degree, but it definitely hinders progress.

Sarah: So it's like, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," even if it's subtly broken?

Joe:  Exactly.  And sometimes, even if they *know* an antibody isn't ideal, they might continue using it because it's convenient, readily available, or they simply haven't had the time or resources to properly validate a new one.  There's a real cost, both in terms of time and funding, to switching to a better antibody.

Sarah:  So it's not just about the technical aspects; it's about the practical realities of research life, too.  The incentives aren't always aligned with best practices, are they?  I mean, publishing papers is often prioritized over rigorous validation.

Joe:  Absolutely. The pressure to publish quickly can incentivize using readily available, potentially less reliable antibodies, rather than investing the time and effort to validate a new, more robust one.  There's a disconnect between the ideal scientific process and the realities of funding cycles and career progression.

Sarah: Hmm.  So, even with the improvements in antibody production and the efforts to improve data sharing, the human element – the researcher's behavior and the systemic pressures they face – remains a significant hurdle?

Joe:  Precisely.  It's a complex interplay of technical limitations, systemic flaws, and human behavior.  Addressing the problem requires tackling all these aspects simultaneously.  It's not a simple fix.  The move towards recombinant antibodies is a step in the right direction, but even that doesn't solve the problem entirely.  Researchers still need to validate their antibodies, regardless of how they're produced.

Sarah: So, ultimately, even with all these improvements, the responsibility for ensuring the reliability of their results still rests with the individual researchers?

Joe: Yes, ultimately, the onus is on the researcher to ensure they're using validated antibodies and reporting their findings accurately.  The systems and the improved antibody production are designed to *support* that responsibility, but they can't replace it.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 (Podcast intro music fades out)

**Sarah:** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about antibody validation, and it sounds… complicated.  You know,  I’m getting a little overwhelmed.  Can you maybe just summarize the key ways researchers check if their antibodies are actually doing what they’re supposed to do?

**Joe:** Sure, Sarah.  Um, basically, there are a few main approaches.  The first is immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  This is where you essentially stain cells, right?  If the antibody is specific, it'll only bind to cells expressing the protein you're interested in.  So you can see, visually, if it's working.

**Sarah:** Okay, so it’s like a visual test.  Like, a "does it stick?" test?

**Joe:**  Yeah, you could say that.  Another method is Western blotting.  This one's a bit more… technical.  You run a protein sample through a gel, and then the antibody is used to detect a specific protein based on its size, its molecular weight.  If you see a band at the expected size, it suggests the antibody is binding to the right protein.

**Sarah:** So, you're separating proteins by size, and the antibody only sticks to the one you're looking for?  And that’s how you know it’s working?

**Joe:** Exactly.  And then there's immunoprecipitation.  This one’s… well, it’s more involved. You use the antibody to essentially fish out the specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then you can confirm the identity of the protein using something like mass spectrometry – a very precise way of identifying molecules.

**Sarah:** Wow, that sounds really precise.  So, basically, you're using three different techniques to cross-check each other?  It's like a three-legged stool – if one leg is weak, the others might help you stay upright?

**Joe:**  (Chuckles)  You could put it that way. It's more about multiple lines of evidence, really.  Each technique provides different information, and using them together gives you a much more robust confirmation of the antibody's specificity and reliability.  It’s not foolproof, of course. There are always potential pitfalls, but multiple validation methods significantly reduce the chances of error.

**Sarah:** So even with all these methods, there’s still a chance of mistakes?  That’s… a bit concerning, I have to admit.


**Joe:**  Yes, that’s why the responsibility lies with the researcher.  The methods are there to help, to minimize errors, but they don't eliminate human error or unforeseen issues entirely.  Ultimately, careful experimental design and rigorous data analysis are key.


**Sarah:**  Right. It all comes back to careful work and critical thinking. Thanks for clarifying all of that, Joe.  That was… a lot to take in!


**Joe:**  No problem, Sarah.  Happy to help.  It is a lot, but hopefully, that clarified things a bit.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific studies.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis...it's a big deal, right?  I mean, if the fundamental tools we're using aren't reliable, how can we trust the results?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Um, the problem is huge.  Take, for example, the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying this protein, you know, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, which is implicated in motor neuron disease.  He needed antibodies to, uh, to locate and quantify this protein within cells.  But...he found a real mess.  He looked at sixteen commercially available antibodies, all supposedly targeting this same protein, and only three actually worked properly.  Three out of sixteen!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow.  That's...a pretty low success rate.  So, what makes an antibody "work properly"?  I mean, what are we even looking for here?
[INFO] Sarah: So, these poorly performing antibodies – they're essentially giving scientists false information?  Leading them down the wrong path?
[INFO] Joe: Right. So, an antibody needs two key things: specificity and selectivity. Specificity means it strongly binds *only* to the target protein.  Selectivity means it doesn't bind to other proteins in the cell.  It's like, um, a really precise lock and key.  If the key (the antibody) fits only one lock (the target protein), and doesn’t accidentally open other locks, it's a good antibody.  If it's binding all over the place, it's useless, and potentially misleading.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  And Laflamme found that one particular antibody, which didn't even bind to the correct protein, had been used in about fifteen published studies – cited over 3,000 times! Think about the wasted time, resources, and potentially, the incorrect conclusions drawn from those studies. It's a huge problem.  This isn't just one isolated incident, either.  This is a systemic issue plaguing the field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: There is hope!  There are several initiatives springing up to address this.  One is called iCharOS – that's "Icarus" –  a project aiming to characterize every commercially available antibody for human proteins.  They're systematically testing them to see which ones actually work.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production, make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones, and to just generally improve best practices in antibody selection and use.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funders, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a long and difficult road to fixing this, but it's definitely necessary. Thanks for explaining this, Joe. I think a lot of listeners will find this incredibly important and eye-opening.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology in research.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely, Sarah.  And it shows how even the most fundamental tools in our scientific toolkit can sometimes let us down.  It's a reminder that constant vigilance and critical assessment are crucial for reliable scientific progress.
[INFO] Joe: Right, so Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is fascinating.  It highlights a critical issue – the unreliability of commercially available antibodies.  What’s striking is the sheer scale of the problem;  millions of antibodies on the market, a significant portion of which, according to their findings, don't perform as advertised.  The methodology they employ, comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein, is pretty straightforward, you know?  It’s a basic control, but incredibly important.  The lack of such rigorous testing is, frankly, shocking.
[INFO] Sarah: It is shocking, Joe.  And it speaks to a system-wide problem, doesn't it?  I mean, you've got these massive catalogs, these companies producing antibodies on a huge scale.  There's a real incentive to sell, right?  To get those products out there, even if the testing isn't as thorough as it should be.  But YCharOS's collaborative approach, getting buy-in from the manufacturers themselves, that's pretty innovative.  It's almost a self-regulating mechanism, isn't it?  Though, even with their efforts, it sounds like it’s still a drop in the ocean.  They’ve tested a thousand, but there are millions out there.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a significant undertaking, but it’s also a limited scope.  They're focusing on a specific set of applications and cell types.  The point Cecilia Williams makes about context is crucial.  An antibody might perform flawlessly in one setting but completely fail in another, due to things like different tissue environments or experimental protocols.  That’s where initiatives like OMAPs come in, looking at the same antibodies across various contexts.  It's almost like two sides of the same coin; YCharOS provides rigorous characterization under specific conditions, while OMAPs focuses on validating performance across diverse contexts.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not just about the antibody itself, but also the environment in which it's used?  It's a complex interplay of factors.  And that makes it even more challenging to guarantee reliability, doesn’t it?  It's almost like... um...  think of it like a key and a lock, but the lock's design can change depending on the circumstances.  A key that works perfectly in one lock might not work at all in another slightly different lock.
[INFO] Joe: (chuckles)  I see what you mean.  While that analogy works on a surface level, it simplifies a highly intricate biological reality.  The interaction between an antibody and its target is far more nuanced than a simple key-lock system.  Factors such as post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and the presence of other molecules in the cellular environment all play a significant role.  But your point about the complexity and the need for multiple layers of validation is entirely correct.  Both YCharOS and OMAPs represent valuable, yet complementary, approaches to addressing this critical issue.  One's not a replacement for the other; they're both needed.
[INFO] Sarah: So, essentially, we need a multi-pronged approach to ensure antibody reliability.  It's not a quick fix, and it requires substantial collaboration between researchers, manufacturers, and funding bodies.  It’s a bit daunting, but incredibly important work.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the need for reliable antibodies, and the sheer scale of the problem.  But you mentioned these RRIDs – research resource identifiers –  can you explain how they actually help?  It sounds a bit like a cataloging system, but for science?
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so that addresses the "finding" problem.  But what about the "trust" problem?  How do we know an antibody actually *works* as it's supposed to?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, exactly.  It's like a global, persistent barcode for antibodies, and other research resources.  Think of it this way... um,  well, forget the analogy.  Basically,  a catalogue number from a company might disappear if the company stops making the antibody, or two different companies might accidentally use the same number.  RRIDs are unique and permanent identifiers,  so researchers can always find the *exact* antibody used in a published study, regardless of whether the original supplier still exists.  It's a crucial step towards reproducibility.
[INFO] Joe: That's the much harder part.  The article mentions CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies, which is helpful, you know, because it shows how often an antibody's been cited.  High citation counts suggest it’s been used a lot, implying a degree of trust, but it doesn't guarantee quality.  Then there's the validation issue.  The gold standard is what they call "knock-out validation,"  where you show the antibody only binds to the target protein when that protein is present, and not when it's absent.  But, and this is a big but,  less than 5% of antibodies have this kind of validation.  It's a massive problem.
[INFO] Sarah: So, citation counts are a weak indicator at best, and proper validation is rare.  It sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.  This whole thing makes me wonder, are there any initiatives trying to directly address the validation issue?  Beyond just creating identifiers.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  The article mentions the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community.  They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies – the whole ecosystem, really – to collaborate on solutions.  It’s a multi-pronged approach, like we discussed earlier.  They're trying to establish better standards for validation, encourage manufacturers to provide more comprehensive data, and work with journals to require better antibody reporting.  It's a long-term project,  a huge undertaking, but it's a necessary one.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like it is. It's a bit overwhelming to think about how many factors contribute to this problem, and how much coordinated effort it takes to fix it.  But hopefully, initiatives like OGA are making a real difference.  So, if a researcher is starting a new project today, what's the single most important thing they should do to ensure they're using reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Hmm, that's a tough one.  There isn't one single magic bullet. But prioritizing antibodies with strong validation data, using resources like CiteAb to check citation counts and available validation information, and always making sure to record the RRID – that's a pretty good starting point.  It's about being as diligent as possible, and acknowledging that it's an ongoing challenge.  It's not just about the antibody itself, but the entire process of selecting, using, and reporting on it.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, it's a systems problem. Thanks, Joe.  That was really insightful.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so we've talked about the systemic issues with antibody reliability.  But you mentioned earlier that it's not *just* a systems problem.  What other factors are at play here?  I mean, scientists are using these antibodies, right?  What's their role in this whole mess?
[INFO] Joe: Right, it's a multifaceted problem. The systemic issues – like lack of standardization and poor data sharing – are huge,  but the researcher's behavior is a significant piece of the puzzle, you know?  It's not just about the antibodies themselves.  A lot of it boils down to inertia and, frankly, sometimes resistance to change.
[INFO] Sarah: Resistance to change?  Can you elaborate on that?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Some researchers have been using certain antibodies for years. They've gotten results, even if those results might not be entirely reliable due to the antibody's limitations.  They've built their research around these antibodies, and the idea of switching, validating, or even just acknowledging potential flaws, is... disruptive.

There's a real cost, both in terms of time and funding, to switching to a better antibody.

[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. The pressure to publish quickly can incentivize using readily available, potentially less reliable antibodies, rather than investing the time and effort to validate a new, more robust one.  There's a disconnect between the ideal scientific process and the realities of funding cycles and career progression.
[INFO] Sarah: Hmm.  So, even with the improvements in antibody production and the efforts to improve data sharing, the human element – the researcher's behavior and the systemic pressures they face – remains a significant hurdle?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  It's a complex interplay of technical limitations, systemic flaws, and human behavior.  Addressing the problem requires tackling all these aspects simultaneously.  It's not a simple fix.  The move towards recombinant antibodies is a step in the right direction, but even that doesn't solve the problem entirely.

Joe: CHAPTER ONE Magic Monday It was Monday morning and Mira Desai was VERY excited. This was no ordinary Monday morning. This Monday morning was the first day of the holidays AND it was Miras first day at a new school! Because this was no ordinary school . . . this was: Mira had been desperate to go to Unicorn School since her sister Rani started going two summers ago. Rani wouldnt stop going on about how wonderful her unicorn (Angelica) was. She kept saying how amazing she was at all the magical quests. And she was always making whinnying noises in Miras ear to make her jealous. AND shed brought home about a hundred Unicorn School quest medals, which had their own special shelf in the living room. Rani said that quests could go on for days and days and were super exciting. And the time Rani spent at Unicorn School did seem like ages to Mira. But time passed differently at Unicorn School, and Rani was really only ever gone for a day in normal time. Mira had dreamed of having her own unicorn since FOREVER. She practised plaiting the manes and tails of all her toy horses, persuaded her dad to let her groom his beard and even tried attaching a horn to their cat, Pickles. He wasnt very pleased. It was a bit of a mystery who was selected to go to Unicorn School and who wasnt. Lots of people from Miras family had gone to Unicorn School, including Miras mum, so Mira hoped more than anything that she would get to go, too. Mira always tried to live her life as open to magic as possible. She wished on stars, she believed in fairies, she said hello to black cats who crossed her path. And then, one incredible day, Mira woke up with a sparkly envelope on her pillow. Mira remembered it as if it was yesterday. (It was actually last Thursday.) She screamed so loudly that Pickles flung himself off Miras bed into a pile of dirty clothes, and Miras dad came running in to check what was wrong. But there was nothing wrong. Everything was finally right. Her hands shaking with excitement, Mira opened the letter: Dear Mira Desai, We are delighted to invite you to join us at Unicorn School. You will be in Class RED. Please use the Magic Portal to access the school. We look forward to seeing you soon. Yours sincerely, Madame Shetland DAD! Mira yelled and started jumping on the bed. IM GOING TO UNICORN SCHOOL! Terrified, Pickles jumped on to Miras dads face and wouldnt let go of his beard. Mfmfmfmf! he said cheerfully and gave Mira a thumbs up, before leaving the room and walking into the wall. Mira reached inside the envelope and pulled out a leaflet containing all the information about the school, including a map and the School Rules. Mira thought she might faint with delight. Unicorn School was going to be BRILLIANT! For one thing, Mira couldnt WAIT to bring home her own medals. Shed already started making a space for them on the shelf (and had accidentally knocked a couple of Ranis medals into Pickless bowl). But the thing Mira was MOST excited about was getting to meet her unicorn. Her sister said that the unicorns were specially chosen for each person for specific magical reasons. You would get to spend all day every day with your unicorn: going to lessons, working on projects and going on quests. (Basically your unicorn would be your best friend.) Mira did have a best friend already at normal school (Katie with a K) but she could definitely squeeze another one into her life. Shed spent a lot of time thinking about her dream unicorn best friend (Princess Delilah Sparklehoof). Shed filled a whole notebook with drawings of her and made a list of all the brilliant things they would do together. 1. Have amazing, magical adventures! 2. Be great at quests 3. Get LOADS OF MEDALS Before heading to the Magic Portal that would take them to Unicorn School, Miras mum took them to the supermarket. Mira and Rani needed to get treats for their unicorns and Mum needed to buy doughnuts for someones birthday at work. Mira was wondering what treats unicorns like.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: Hey there, super listeners!  It’s Sarah here, ready to jump into the magical world of Unicorn School with Joe!  Joe, tell us more about Mira’s exciting first day!

Joe:  Woohoo! Mira’s super excited, Sarah!  It’s her first day at Unicorn School, and that’s way more exciting than just a regular Monday, right? Imagine waking up to a sparkly letter inviting you to a school where your best friend is a unicorn!  

Sarah: A unicorn?! That’s amazing!  What kind of treats do you think unicorns like?  Do they like carrots like regular horses?  Or maybe something sparkly and magical?

Joe: Great question, Sarah!  Mira’s wondering that too! Maybe they like rainbow-colored cupcakes or shimmering sugar cubes? Or maybe they prefer moonbeams and stardust? We’ll find out what Mira picks at the supermarket!

Sarah: Oh, I can't wait!  Before we get to the supermarket, let's have a quick quiz! True or false: Unicorns can fly!

Joe:  Ooh, tricky one!  Let’s think…some stories say they can, but in Mira's world, we'll have to see!  We’ll find out more as the story goes on!  Let’s hear some guesses from our amazing listeners!

Sarah:  Exactly! Now, imagine this: You’re at Unicorn School. What’s the first magical thing you’d do?  Would you learn a spell?  Ride your unicorn on a rainbow?  Tell us your amazing ideas!

Joe: I know what I’d do! I’d totally try to make a unicorn rainbow sundae!  With sprinkles of stardust, of course!

Sarah: That sounds delicious!  Okay, back to Mira.  She’s at the supermarket with her mom and sister Rani.  Mira’s trying to decide what treats to get for her unicorn.  What do you think she should choose?  Should she get something healthy, like special unicorn hay? Or something sweet, like magical rainbow cookies?

Joe:  I bet unicorns love anything sparkly and shiny! Maybe some glittery apples or rainbow-colored carrots!  And maybe a giant lollipop that sparkles!  What do YOU think, listeners? Shout out your ideas!

Sarah:  Great ideas, Joe!  This is getting so exciting! I wonder what kind of unicorn Mira will get.  Will it be a fluffy one? A sparkly one? A unicorn with a rainbow mane?  It’s so exciting to think about what's waiting for Mira at Unicorn School!  We'll have to wait and see!

Joe: That's right, Sarah!  And remember kids, stay tuned for more magical adventures with Mira at Unicorn School! Until next time, keep believing in magic!

Sarah: Which aisle do you go to for magic treats? she thought to herself. But when she asked her sister Rani rolled her eyes and said, Unicorns like carrots, obviously. And so they all headed over to the vegetable aisle. When theyd bought their carrots they went back to the car. Rani also had some hay left over from last term and Mum thought it would be nice if she shared it with Mira. The Magic Portal was in the car park by the leisure centre. Mira had never actually seen it the portal could only be seen by current Unicorn School pupils. Even Miras mum couldnt see it any more, since she had left Unicorn School roughly a thousand years ago. Usually when they dropped her off, Rani got out round the corner so that she wouldnt be seen with them. But TODAY Mira would be going with her. And she would be one step closer to meeting her unicorn! There had been quite a bit of traffic on the way and Mum was running late for work. Its okay, Mum, said Rani. Ill take Mira through. Mum looked from one sister to the other and then at her watch. Fine, she said. And then she fixed Rani with a LOOK. Make sure you take care of your little sister on her first day. Mum handed them their treat bags, gave them both a hug and jumped back in the car. Rani had already started stomping off when Mum rolled down her window. She leaned out with her phone in hand. Girls! Let me take a picture. Your first day at Unicorn School together! Rani turned, tutted and folded her arms. MUM, are you crying? Thats so embarrassing. Mum sniffed. It brings back such amazing memories of MY first day at Unicorn School! Oh, happy times . . . Their mum stared off into the distance for a moment, before she smiled again and blew her nose. Now, smile girls! Rani rolled her eyes. Mira smiled and gave two thumbs up as Mums phone camera CLICKED. Love you, girls. Have fun! Mum drove off, waving one hand at them out of the window as she left the car park. Mira felt a bit nervous. Wheres the Magic Portal? she asked Rani. Over here, said her sister. Come on. Rani stopped by the wheelie bins in the corner of the car park. So you have to get in the bin, spin round three times and then jump out and scream. Then youll be at Unicorn School, she said. Mira looked up at the bin. Are you sure? she said. Er, which one of us has a medal for being the Best at the Magic Portal? said her sister. Okay . . . said Mira. Mira clambered into the bin and held her breath. This was SO exciting! (Also, it really stank.) In just a few seconds shed be in Unicorn School . . . CHAPTER TWO Through the Portal Mira leaped out of the bin, yelling at the top of her voice. AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGH! came the reply, as she collided with someone. Mira looked down to see a boy on the ground, staring up at her with wide eyes. Behind him was a man cowering by a bike rack. Oh, hello! said Mira, as she helped the boy up. Sorry about that. The boy stared at her warily. So this is Unicorn School, she said, looking around. To be honest, it didnt look very different to the leisure centre car park. Uh no, said the man by the bike racks. Mira supposed he must be the boys dad because they looked quite alike and had matching briefcases. This is where you go through the Magic Portal to get to the school. Raheem is just about to go through. He gestured at the boy, who gulped. But said Mira, as she looked around for her sister who was nowhere to be seen. And then she realized Rani had tricked her and gone through on her own! TYPICAL. We can show you if you like? said Raheems dad. Its Raheems first day. Weve had twelve practice runs, just to be safe. He squeezed Raheems shoulder. Do . . . do you live in that bin? squeaked Raheem. No! I was just . . . resting there before I went through the portal, said Mira. Its my first day too Im Mira. It would be brilliant if you could show me. She followed the two of them past the bins and to a little clump of bushes at the edge of the car park.

**Joe:** Hey there, super listeners! Welcome back to "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"  Today, we're diving headfirst into a magical mystery! Sarah, are you ready for some fantastical fun?

**Sarah:** (Energetic and excited) Joe! I'm bursting with excitement!  Especially after that sneaky Rani trick!  Can you believe she left poor Mira to figure out the "Magic Portal" all by herself?!

**Joe:**  (Chuckles)  That Rani! She's a mischievous one, isn't she?  But hey, it led Mira to a new adventure!  Remember kids, sometimes the best adventures happen when we least expect them!  So, let's recap! Mira thought she had to jump in a bin, spin around, and scream to get to Unicorn School.  What a hilarious misunderstanding!

**Sarah:**  (Laughing) A bin?!  That's the silliest magic portal ever!  It’s like trying to get to a candy shop by climbing into a washing machine!

**Joe:** Exactly! It just goes to show that sometimes, things aren't always what they seem! So, Mira, instead of finding a magical portal, bumped into Raheem and his dad, who were *actually* about to use the *real* Magic Portal!

**Sarah:**  I bet Raheem was just as surprised as Mira!  Imagine, you're about to go to magic school, and BAM! You get tackled by a girl who just emerged from a wheelie bin!

**(Sound of a comical "BAM!")**

**Joe:**  (Laughing) That's a great image, Sarah!  Kids, let's play a quick game!  If you were going to a magical school, what silly way would YOU think the entrance was?  Maybe a giant lollipop? A talking mailbox? Let your imaginations run wild!

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Sarah:**  Okay, now that we've had some fun imagining, let's talk about real magic!  Or, in this case, the *real* Magic Portal. What do you think it might look like?  Is it sparkly? Does it shimmer? Does it smell like rainbows and cupcakes?

**Joe:** That's a great question, Sarah!  Maybe it's hidden in plain sight, like a secret doorway disguised as a tree! Or perhaps it's a shimmering pool of water that leads to another world!  What do YOU think, kids?

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Sarah:** This whole situation reminds me of a riddle! Ready?  I have a door, but no key. I have a space, but no room. You can enter, but can't go outside. What am I?

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Joe:**  That's a clever one, Sarah!  The answer is a Magic Portal!  It has an entrance, but no exit in the traditional sense. It transports you to a different place entirely!

**Sarah:** Exactly! And that’s just what happens to Mira, Raheem, and his dad. They find the real Magic Portal, and who knows what magical adventures await them on the other side!  Tune in next time to find out!

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music swells and then fades out)**

**Joe:**  That's all the time we have for today, kids!  Remember to keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"  Bye for now!

Joe: Raheem and his dad showed her a gap in the branches where the air looked kind of wobbly and shimmery. Magic, thought Mira. Her tummy gave a little lurch. This was really it! Mira waited for Raheem to say bye to his dad. It took a while because they checked Raheems briefcase twice and then sang a song about the ten Rules of Keeping Safe. But finally Mira and Raheem crawled through the gap in the bushes and into a clearing. Everything looked just a little bit sparkly. Okay, breathed Mira. Ready? Erfg, said Raheem. Mira decided to take that as a yes. She grabbed his arm with one hand and reached out towards the sparkles . . . There was a flash of light that split into the seven colours of the rainbow. Mira felt herself being lifted up and before she knew it they were hurtling through the air. Miras toes tingled and a giggly feeling tickled up her legs, into her tummy and arms and head. Even her hair felt excited. Everything was already so magical, she could hardly stand it. She was on her way to Unicorn School! HOW FUN IS THIS? Mira yelled to Raheem, but he was too busy screaming to reply. Just as quickly as it had appeared, the rainbow light vanished, and for a moment the two of them hung in the air, before dropping with a thump onto a soft haystack. They climbed off the landing haystack, just as the next children were deposited by the rainbow. Mira looked around her and pulled strands of hay out of her hair. In front of them was Unicorn School. It was HUGE. It had turrets and a clocktower and looked a bit like a castle, but lots of it was all on one level, like a bungalow. (Because unicorns dont like stairs, Mira thought. There was nothing about unicorns that she didnt know.) Rani had told Mira that the dormitories, where the pupils slept at night- time, were up in the turrets and that the unicorns slept in their stables. The stables were in a large cobbled yard in front of the school. On the other side of the yard were fields with jumps set up. Those must be where the riding lessons are, Mira thought. She had never been horse- riding, but she had ridden a one-eared donkey at the beach last summer. She thought that unicorn-riding must be easier than that and there would be less chance of falling in the sea. Behind the school, Mira could see the forest and, behind that, enormous ice-capped mountains. Rani said that the Fearsome Forest was where lots of the quests took place. It was huge stretching as far as Mira could see. Miras toes were still tingling. She turned to Raheem and grinned. He still looked a bit vomity from the journey. The rainbow had dropped them off to the side of the Grand Paddock, which seemed to be the school playground for humans and unicorns. Real. Live. Actual. Unicorns! Groups of older kids stood chatting, each with a unicorn next to them, like it was no big deal. Mira realized her mouth was open in astonishment, and quickly closed it. One group were playing football, but they were riding their unicorns, and the unicorns were kicking the ball with their hooves! And over in a far corner of the field some unicorns and their riders were leaping over the jumps. Mira thought they looked a bit like they were flying. Rani had told her that the unicorns developed magical powers as they got older, and that some of them could fly! The excited feeling in Miras chest got bigger and bigger until she felt like she might burst. The unicorns were all amazing different colours with long legs, sleek, glossy manes and glittery horns. It was amazing to think that soon Mira would meet her very own unicorn! Just then Mira heard a burst of laughter to her right. There was Rani and her friends. They were in the third year now Class Yellow. You started in Class Red and then moved up through the colours of the rainbow. And each year you had another stripe added to your school badge. Mira looked at the badge on the sleeve of her T-shirt.

 **(Sound of playful, whimsical music intro)**

**Joe:** Hey there, super explorers! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!

**Sarah:**  Heeey everyone! Are you ready for another amazing adventure? Today, we're going to Unicorn School!  Can you believe it?!

**Joe:** I know, right?! It's even more magical than a rainbow made of jellybeans! (Laughs)

**Sarah:** Speaking of rainbows, remember how Mira and Raheem zoomed through one to get to Unicorn School?  It was a super speedy, sparkly ride!  Imagine that feeling – whoosh! – like flying on a fluffy cloud!

**Joe:**  And Unicorn School is HUGE!  It's got turrets, a clock tower, and even stables for the unicorns!  Did you know that unicorns don't like stairs? That's why the school is mostly one level!

**Sarah:**  That’s a very unicorn-y fact!  Now, quick trivia question: What do you think the unicorns use to kick the ball in their unicorn football game?

**(Sound of a playful chime)**

**Joe:**  Is it their noses? Their tails? Or their hooves?  Think hard!

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Sarah:** The answer is… their hooves!  They're super talented athletes!

**Joe:**  And get this – some of the older unicorns can even FLY! Can you imagine riding a flying unicorn?

**Sarah:**  Imagine this! You're soaring high above the Fearsome Forest on your unicorn, the wind in your hair, and you spot a sparkly treasure chest below! What would you do?

**(Pause for a moment)**

**Joe:**  That's awesome!  Mira and Raheem are meeting their unicorns soon, and they start in Class Red, then move through the colors of the rainbow! What color do you think their badges will be next year?

**(Sound of a playful chime)**

**Sarah:** That's right! It depends on what class they are in!  Amazing, isn't it?

**Joe:**  Unicorn School sounds like the most magical place ever! Remember kids, keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music outro)**

Sarah: What would it look like when she had a full rainbow? Um, said Raheem, taking her out of her daydream. I think we go over there. Turning away from her sister, Mira followed Raheem over to a big banner near the stables that read: WELCOME TO UNICORN SCHOOL, CLASS RED! CHAPTER THREE Unicorn Best Friend Forever! The bell in the clocktower chimed and everyone gathered in their classes. Miras class was the only one with just humans each of the other six class groups were made up of children and unicorns! Seven teachers filed out of the school. Each of them wore a differentcoloured rosette with their name on. A tall, dark-haired teacher stopped in front of Miras class. She was wearing a red rosette which said, Miss Glitterhorn. Good morning, Class Red, said Miss Glitterhorn. Good moooooorning, Miss Glitterhorn! chorused Class Red. Now, before we head into assembly to meet the unicorns, I thought that it would be nice if we all got to know each other! trilled Miss Glitterhorn. Mira sighed. She was SO impatient to meet her new unicorn best friend . . . but she did like the idea of learning her classmates names. After all, they would be her friends too! A girl at the front put her hand up. She had blonde curly hair and was in a wheelchair with rainbow wheels. Yes? Miss Glitterhorn beamed. Do you actually have a horn? No, I dont, said Miss Glitterhorn. She smiled. Now, well all play a getting-to-know-you game where The girl put her hand up again. Yes? said Miss Glitterhorn. Do you have unicorns in your family? No, I dont, said Miss Glitterhorn. She smiled again, although it was a bit smaller this time. So we The girl put her hand up again. So, is it a coincidence that you are called Miss Glitterhorn? YES, said Miss Glitterhorn. Anyway After seventeen questions Miss Glitterhorn decided that actually they would go straight to the assembly and they could get to know each other on the way. Mira and Raheem walked alongside the girl whod been asking all the questions. She told them her name was Darcy and that she was going to be famous one day. Wow, said Raheem. How will you be famous? Darcy shrugged. Ill win a TV talent show probably. My dad says those shows are for people with no talent, said a boy walking next to them. His footsteps were really loud and Mira saw that he was wearing cowboy boots. He had a mop of dirty blond hair and a smug mouth. Mira had heard him saying earlier how his parents were Olympic showjumpers and were making sure he was given the best unicorn. Darcy opened her mouth to reply, but theyd reached the hall and a sternlooking teacher gave her a warning look. Mira gasped when she saw the Great Hall, which was in the centre of the main school building. It was a beautiful indoor paddock and the grass was sprinkled with wildflowers. At one end was a platform, with a glittery mounting block next to it. Around the sides of the hall was a gallery for people to sit in. The other six classes were already there with their unicorns. Miss Glitterhorn pointed Class Red to the front row. Mira felt a flutter of pride. Her sister would be there to see her get her unicorn! A hush descended on the hall, and a tiny woman walked across the paddock and onto the platform. Miss Glitterhorn joined her a moment later, clutching an armful of scrolls and a clipboard. The first woman introduced herself she was Madame Shetland, the head teacher. Madame Shetland cleared her throat and spoke into her microphone. Good morning children and unicorns, and welcome to a new term at Unicorn School. And an extra special welcome to our new students, Class Red, who I trust have been busy learning the School Rules in preparation, said the head teacher. Unicorn School is a place of fun, magic and adventure but it is something to be taken seriously. The bond between child and unicorn is a noble tradition, going back many centuries.

Joe: Alongside your unicorn you will learn and grow to undertake quests and become the protectors of our land, and shine a glittery light throughout the unicorn world. Mira felt a warm glow as she thought how she would definitely take it seriously. And she would definitely follow ALL the rules. As soon as she knew what they were. The head teacher smiled at the gathered pupils. And, of course, even when not at Unicorn School you will take forth the lessons learned here and promote the principles of friendship, kindness, bravery and tolerance. After everyone applauded Madame Shetland, it was FINALLY time for the pairing of Class Red with their unicorns. Mira thought she might explode! Miss Glitterhorn handed the head teacher the clipboard. Jake de Quincy, said Madame Shetland, looking at the clipboard. Mira saw a boy walking up to the platform. It was the one with blonde hair who was wearing cowboy boots. He was carrying his own riding hat with golden wings over the ears. Madame Shetland held the microphone towards Jake. If you could tell us about yourself. Keep it brief. Jake leaned in to the microphone. Im Jake. And Im going to be a champion unicorn showjumper, just like my mum and dad. Miss Glitterhorn handed Jake a scroll, which he held up in front of him. The name of your unicorn will appear on the scroll, declared Madame Shetland. The class gasped as a projection of the scroll appeared on the wall behind him. There was a hushed silence as they waited. The scroll shimmered and then a blurry word appeared. Everyone leaned forward to try and read it as the letters gradually became clear and sharp: Then there was a loud noise from the front of the hall as the double doors swung open, making them all jump. Mira let out an excited squeal and Raheem nearly fell off his chair. Standing proudly in the doorway, was a sparkling, majestic unicorn. He was deep purple with a dark blue mane and a glittering golden horn. He strode towards the mounting block where Jake waited with his arms folded and his eyebrows arched confidently. Mira couldnt contain her excitement and gripped the hands of Raheem and Darcy, until Darcy muttered to her to get off and Raheem looked really uncomfortable. Jake and Pegasus walked away from the platform to the other end of the hall, and Mira felt slightly relieved that they wouldnt have to ride the unicorns in front of everyone. Darcy was the next to be called. She wheeled up a ramp and onto the platform. Madame Shetland held the microphone towards her and Darcy grabbed it. Wow. What can I say? This moment means SO much. I want to thank my mum A speech is not necessary, Darcy! interrupted Madame Shetland. Darcys scroll appeared on the projection. A dramatic whinny came from the double doors and the class turned to look. A unicorn came strutting in her silver coat shimmered and caught the light as she walked. She arrived next to Darcy, swished her mane and struck a pose. Darcy applauded in delight. They made their way over to Jake and Pegasus, and started taking selfies until a teacher confiscated Darcys phone. Next was Seb, who said he loved art. He looked super-excited to meet his unicorn, Firework, who had a rainbow-coloured mane. Then it was Raheems turn. He stayed frozen to his seat when his name was called so Mira gave him an encouraging shove to get him to his feet. Good luck! she whispered. He gulped and made his way to the platform. My name is Raheem and I like books, he said carefully into the microphone. I bet he gets a really clever unicorn, thought Mira. Itll probably be able to read and everything. A loud thundering sound could be heard from outside the hall and the floor seemed to shake. And then a blue shape came galloping into the hall. The unicorn was a blur, racing around the hall before coming to a sudden stop in front of the platform with a stamp of his front hoof. He was midnight blue and the biggest, tallest unicorn theyd seen so far.

 **(Sound of playful, whimsical music intro)**

**Joe:** Hey adventurers! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!

**Sarah:**  Hi everyone! Are you ready for another super-duper exciting episode?

**Joe:** Today, we're diving headfirst into the magical world of unicorns! Remember Mira and her friends at Unicorn School?

**Sarah:** Oh my gosh, yes!  Last time, they were about to meet their very own unicorns!  It was SO exciting!  Remember Jake and his super cool show jumping unicorn, Pegasus?

**Joe:** And Darcy with her sparkly silver unicorn!  And Seb with his rainbow-maned Firework!

**Sarah:**  And Raheem… oh boy, Raheem's unicorn was a BIG surprise!  It was a HUGE, midnight-blue blur!  Remember kids, what do you think made the floor shake when Raheem's unicorn arrived? Let's have a guess!

**(Sound of a short, suspenseful musical sting)**

**Joe:** That's a great question! Maybe it was the unicorn's super-powerful hooves? Or maybe it was magic!  What do YOU think?  Let us know in the comments!

**Sarah:**  Now, imagine this! You're at Unicorn School too, and it's YOUR turn to meet your unicorn. What color would it be? What would its name be?  Would it have a special talent?

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music interlude)**

**Joe:**  Speaking of talents, did you know that unicorns aren't just about magic and rainbows?  They're super smart too! Just like how your brain helps you learn and solve puzzles, a unicorn's horn might have special powers, like healing plants or even creating rainbows!

**Sarah:**  That's right! It's like a unicorn's horn is a super-powered antenna for magic!  And just like how your body needs healthy food to grow strong, unicorns need special flowers and sparkling water to keep their magic strong.

**Joe:** Here's a fun fact! Unicorns love riddles!  Let's try one: I have a horn, but I'm not a rhino. I'm magical, but I'm not a fairy. What am I?

**(Sound of a short musical sting)**

**Sarah:**  That's right, it's a unicorn!  

**Joe:**  Great job, everyone!  Now, remember, just like unicorns show kindness, bravery, and friendship, we should too!  Being kind to others is like giving them a sparkling rainbow of happiness!

**Sarah:**  Exactly! And being brave is like galloping towards your dreams, even if they seem a little scary at first!

**Joe:**  So, keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"

**(Sound of playful, whimsical music outro)**

Sarah: Madame Shetland turned to Raheem, only to find he wasnt there, but she soon coaxed him out from behind the mounting block. Brave strutted over to the line of unicorns with Raheem following at a careful distance. More and more children were called up. As each name was read out Mira felt her heart leap into her throat, and then sink back down again. Finally, she looked around and realized she was the only one in Class Red without a unicorn. And finally we have Mira Des began Madame Shetland and then she jumped to see Mira already standing next to her. Im Mira. And I cant wait to meet my unicorn best friend, said Mira into the microphone. She looked over at her sister in the crowd, who gave a deliberate yawn. And I cant wait to win LOADS of medals, said Mira. Madame Shetland looked at her and raised one eyebrow. Miss Glitterhorn handed her the scroll. Miras heart was hammering in her chest. Everyone in the crowd turned towards the double doors. But there was no sign of her unicorn yet. Mira looked back down at her scroll. She could see the word beginning to form. It wasnt long enough to be Princess Delilah Sparklehoof, but the first letter was a D . . . Dancer? Dasher? DESTINY? A surprised sort of gasp echoed around the hall. Mira peered closer at the scroll. It definitely said Dave. Again the heads turned towards the door . . . Again there was no unicorn. Madame Shetland looked over at Miss Glitterhorn, who said, Just a sec, and jogged over to the double doors. She started clicking and waving at something outside. But whatever was being clicked and waved at didnt seem to want to come in. Eventually Madame Shetland went over to help and between them they pushed in the smallest, plumpest unicorn Mira had ever seen. He had his bottom planted firmly on the ground and was making it as difficult as possible for the two teachers to move him. Mira stared. He had a little pot belly and a mane like straw that stuck up at odd angles. Greet your unicorn, dear, said Madame Shetland, giving a slightly forced smile. Miss Glitterhorn was leaning against the mounting block and sweating. Hi . . . Dave, said Mira. The unicorn looked up at her. Okay, so he was a bit small. And he wasnt very glittery. But at least I have a unicorn! she thought. Mira reached out to pat his nose and Dave snorted loudly and put his ears back. She pulled her hand away. A round of applause for our final pair, Mira and Dave! said Madame Shetland. Uncertain claps rippled around the hall. Miras sister was laughing so hard that she had to be taken outside. Mira looked back at her unicorn. There was a twinkle in Daves eye. Mira felt encouraged. She smiled and waved at the crowd. Dave snorted again and lifted his tail. Then he unleashed a giant heap of poo onto Miss Glitterhorns feet. CHAPTER FOUR Daves Doughnuts It took Mira a while to get from assembly to her first lesson, as Dave had sat down again in the corridor and was refusing to move. But Raheem came to help her and together they half-dragged, half-pushed Dave down the hallway on his bottom and towards the classroom. Unicorn School was certainly full of surprises. And challenges. Right now, Dave was being quite a challenge, but Mira was sure they would have a magical time as soon as they got to class. Miss Glitterhorn tutted when they finally arrived. She was standing in front of the whiteboard, cleaning Daves poo off her shoes with a wet wipe. As I was saying, Class Red, School Rule Number 19 is Be On Time, Every Time. Mira gasped. The double desks were like normal desks on one side, but on the other there was a taller, unicorn-sized desk with a bag of hay hanging off it. Underneath each unicorns desk was a basket containing grooming equipment. Raheem scurried over to sit at the desk right at the front where Brave was standing proudly. There was one empty double desk. Dave plodded towards it, behind Mira, and gave a snort. Then he finished off his entire hay bag in two bites.

**Joe:** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!

**Sarah:**  Hi everyone! Are you ready for another amazing adventure?  Last time, Mira finally got her unicorn… but it wasn't exactly what she expected! Remember Dave? The slightly… *ahem*…  chunky unicorn with a surprise talent for… well, let's just say leaving his mark!

**Joe:** (Laughing)  A real *pooper* of a situation!  Get it?  A pooper?  Because of the… you know…

**Sarah:** (Laughing)  Okay, Joe!  Let's not dwell on the details!  So, Mira and Dave are in Unicorn School, and it’s anything but ordinary!  Imagine a classroom with regular desks AND giant desks for unicorns, complete with hay bags and grooming kits!

**Joe:**  It’s like a regular school, but with extra magic and… uh…  poo!  Speaking of which, did you know that unicorn poo is actually… (whispers dramatically) …rainbow-colored?

**Sarah:**  (Gasps playfully)  Joe!  Don't make things up!  Though, that would be amazing! But in Mira's case, it was more brown than rainbow!

**(Sound of a playful "boing" sound effect)**

**Joe:**  Okay, okay!  Let's get back to the story. Mira's got a challenge on her hands!  Dave's being a bit… stubborn.  What do you think she should do to get him to cooperate?  Should she bribe him with extra hay?  Sing him a unicorn lullaby?  Maybe tickle his tummy?

**Sarah:**  Great questions!  Maybe a combination of all three?  What do *you* think, listeners?  Let us know on our website!  But in the story, Mira and Raheem worked together to get Dave to class! Teamwork makes the dream work, right?

**Joe:**  Absolutely!  Teamwork is super important, just like the different parts of a plant working together to grow!  The roots are like the teamwork, the stem supports the leaves, and the leaves create food for the whole plant.  It's all connected!

**(Sound of a gentle chime)**

**Sarah:**  Speaking of connections, here's a fun fact!  Did you know that some animals communicate using sounds we can't even hear?  It's like a secret animal language!

**Joe:**  Wow, that's amazing!  Imagine if we could understand what our pets were really saying!

**Sarah:**  It would be so cool! We could even ask Dave what he wants for a snack!

**Joe:** That's a great idea! Maybe Dave wants some extra special unicorn doughnuts?

**Sarah:** Maybe!  We'll have to find out next time!  Join us then for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"

Joe: Theyd made it! Mira gave a happy sigh as she sat down at her desk. Miss Glitterhorn finished running through the School Rules (Mira definitely heard at least some of them) and stood up from behind her desk. Now you have your unicorn, she said, the lessons can begin. We will have two days of lessons, where you will learn all about Unicorn School, and how we look after the land. But, most importantly, you will bond with your unicorns so that on day three, you will be ready to go on your first magical quest. The class oohed and aahed, and there was a buzz of excitement. Mira looked around the room and noticed that Jake and Pegasus were their neighbours. She gave Jake a friendly smile but he was looking at Dave with a disgusted Daves Doughnuts expression on his face. She turned and saw that Dave was gnawing at the corner of the desk. She hoped Miss Glitterhorn wouldnt notice. Right! said Miss Glitterhorn. Lesson one is Getting to Know your Unicorn. You and your unicorn have a very special bond. You were chosen for each other by the purest kind of magic: friendship. But youve only just met and you must earn your unicorns trust. First, grooming. This is very relaxing for unicorns. Pick up your brushes and off you go! Mira picked up a soft brush. Shed read all about grooming. She reached out to put the brush on Daves back and he ducked, avoiding her hand, and side-stepped out of the way. Mira stepped closer to him and tried again but he just did the same thing. Then she tried a different brush but he sidestepped again. They kept doing this and shuffling further and further away from their desk until a girl called Tamsin put her hand up to say that they were making her unicorn feel uncomfortable. Mira dragged Dave back to their desk. She tried hiding the brush behind her back, she tried attaching it to a stick. She even tried brushing herself to show him how nice it was, until Miss Glitterhorn came over to ask what she was doing. Then, hoping to put him in a better mood, Mira gave Dave the unicorn crown Daves Doughnuts shed made for him. Dave looked at the crown thoughtfully for a moment and then he ate it. Mira suddenly had a brilliant idea. Dave must be hungry! Thats why he wasnt paying attention! Mira remembered Miss Glitterhorn saying Treating is Cheating (Unicorn School Rule 54) and You Must Not Bribe Your Unicorn (Unicorn School Rule 3), but this was tending to Daves needs. She was looking after him! She reached into her bag for the treats shed bought with Mum earlier. But the shopping bag was full of doughnuts, not carrots! Mira realized she must have picked up her mums bag by mistake . . . now Dave didnt have ANY treats. (And mum had taken a bag of carrots to work with her.) Mira could feel her eyes welling up with tears as she dropped the doughnuts on the floor. NOTHING was going right today. But something extraordinary was happening to Dave. His nostrils flared and his mouth twitched. With a happy little whinny he gobbled up a doughnut, then another and, before Mira could stop him, he had eaten them all AND the bag. Suddenly, Dave was like a different unicorn. His eyes shone and his mane even looked swishy. He let Mira stroke his soft muzzle and then he stamped a hoof in joy. Mira grabbed a brush and started combing it through his mane. She looked around the room, fizzing with pride. She hoped everyone would see how happy Dave suddenly was he was showing his teeth in a sort of weird grin. He must really like doughnuts, she thought. Maybe she would win a medal for Best at Cheering Up Unicorns! Then it all went wrong. Dave reared up on his hind legs and let out a loud and gleeful neigh. He shot forwards, knocking over a chair. A few children and unicorns turned towards them, startled, and Miss Glitterhorn looked up from her desk.

**Joe:** You bet! Last time, Mira and her unicorn, Dave, were having a bit of a… *ahem*… bumpy start to their unicorn school lessons! Remember?

**Sarah:** Oh yeah! Dave wasn't exactly thrilled about getting groomed!  He was more interested in… doughnuts!

**Joe:**  Exactly!  And Mira accidentally brought doughnuts instead of carrots!  A total unicorn-treat disaster! But wait, there's more!

**(Sound of a magical "whoosh")**

**Sarah:**  Mira was feeling pretty down, but then… Dave had a doughnut-powered transformation! He went from grumpy to giggly in a flash!

**Joe:**  It was like magic!  But then… *bam*! Dave got a little *too* excited and caused a bit of a classroom commotion!  Oops!

**Sarah:**  So, what do you think happened next?  Was Mira in trouble? Did Miss Glitterhorn get mad?  Let's hear some guesses from our awesome listeners!

**(Sound of upbeat, quirky music plays for a few seconds)**

**Joe:**  That's right, adventurers! Send us your guesses!  Maybe Dave learned a valuable lesson about eating too many doughnuts? Or maybe Miss Glitterhorn has a secret stash of extra-delicious unicorn treats?

**Sarah:**  Or maybe… just maybe… Dave discovered a hidden talent! Like, maybe he's secretly a doughnut-powered acrobat? Imagine that!

**(Sound of playful galloping sounds)**

**Joe:**  Imagine Dave doing a doughnut-fueled backflip! Or maybe a doughnut-balancing act on his horn!  That would be amazing!

**Sarah:**  Okay, listeners, let's have a quick quiz! What is one thing you should *never* do to your unicorn, according to Unicorn School Rule 3?

**(Short pause for listener responses)**

**Joe:**  That's right, you should *never* bribe your unicorn!  Remember, friendship and trust are the most important magic of all!

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And we'll find out what happened next in Mira's amazing unicorn adventure next time!  Join us then for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"

Sarah: Then, full of sugary, doughnutty joy, Dave galloped around the classroom, scattering the pupils and their unicorns and destroying the matchstick fairytale castle that Grace Hobbs had brought in as a present for her unicorn and had taken literally weeks to make. Finally, he skidded into Jakes desk and crushed his pencil case. Jake looked furious. After Miss Glitterhorn had wrangled Dave into Daves Doughnuts the Naughty Stall, she announced that since most pupils had successfully groomed their unicorns, the class would now be creating pieces of art together. She suggested that Mira use the time to read the rule book, paying special attention to Unicorn School Rule 79: No Havoc Indoors. Thats one Havoc Point already, Im afraid. Three Havoc Points will result in detention, she said. Then, that pupil and their unicorn will not be able to attend the first quest. Mira felt a panicky feeling in her stomach. She couldnt miss out on the first quest! She snuck a look at Dave over her shoulder and saw that he was happily snoozing in the Naughty Stall. He looked very sweet. But she couldnt quite ignore the thought she kept pushing to the back of her mind. What if they didnt have a totally magical bond? What if Dave wasnt going to be her unicorn best friend? CHAPTER FIVE History Comes Alive . . . After a good nights sleep in Red Dormitory, Mira woke up feeling full of hope for the day ahead. She picked Dave up from his stable and gave him a little pep talk on the way to class. At least he was walking alongside her today. Mira felt that was progress. I know it feels different, being in school now, like a big unicorn. But well get through it together! I know we can be best friends! Dave gave Mira a sideways glance and then did a long, rumbling fart. The first lesson of the day was History of the Unicorn and their teacher, Mr Trotsky, was giving a lecture on famous unicorns of the last thousand years. Mira lost concentration a couple of times, first when another class rode their unicorns past the window and then when Darcy passed round a note saying Would you rather have a unicorn that could breathe fire or one that had electric hooves? And Mr Trotsky did have a slow, droney voice. I hope youve been taking notes, class, Mr Trotsky said, after talking for a very long time. We have another five hundred years of unicorns to get through after our break and then you will each prepare a presentation about a famous unicorn from history, to be performed at the end of the day. Lets make history come alive! After break time Dave trotted over to the grooming basket under their desk. With his front hoof, he knocked everything out of the basket, lay down in it and went to sleep. Mira looked around at the other unicorns who were sitting up nicely at their desks. Some were even helping to take notes. Sebs unicorn, Firework, seemed to be sketching with his horn. Im sure Dave can do that too . . . when hes awake, thought Mira. She smiled and picked out different coloured pens to underline her notes. That cheered her up even more. Top Five Best Unicorns from History Unicornardo da Vinci painter and inventor King Henry the Neighth very fat unicorn who had six wives Winst-horn Churchill unicorn prime minister during the war Queen Boudiccorn the most magnificent Celtic warrior queen unicorn King Arth-horn and the Unicorns of the Round Stable.

 (Upbeat, playful intro music fades)

**Joe:** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!

**Sarah:**  Hi everyone! Are you ready for another exciting adventure? Today, we're diving headfirst into the magical world of…unicorns!

**Joe:**  Woohoo! Unicorns!  But not just any unicorns, Sarah.  These are history-making, note-taking, maybe-a-little-mischievous unicorns!

**Sarah:**  Exactly! Remember Mira and her unicorn, Dave, from last time?  Dave was… well, let's just say he wasn't the most well-behaved unicorn in Unicorn School.

**Joe:**  He was more of a…doughnut-loving, classroom-galloping, havoc-causing unicorn!  Remember the matchstick castle?

**Sarah:**  Oh boy!  Poor Grace Hobbs!  But today, Mira's facing a new challenge: History class!  And Mr. Trotsky is teaching about famous unicorns throughout history!

**Joe:**  Can you believe it?  Unicorns in history! Imagine a unicorn painter like Unicornardo da Vinci!

**Sarah:** Or a super-fat unicorn king with six wives!  King Henry the Neighth, but with a horn!  Hee hee!

**Joe:**  And get this – a unicorn prime minister! Winst-horn Churchill!  That's a pun, kids!  It's funny because it sounds like Winston Churchill!

**Sarah:**  High five, Joe!  And the best part?  Mira has to give a presentation about a famous unicorn!  That's a big responsibility!

**(Sound effect: a playful "boing!")**

**Joe:**  Hey, listeners!  Quick trivia question! Which famous unicorn was a magnificent Celtic warrior queen?  Is it A) Unicornardo da Vinci, B) King Henry the Neighth, or C) Queen Boudiccorn?

**Sarah:** You got it! Think carefully and shout out your answer!

**(Pause for a few seconds)**

**Joe:** The answer is C) Queen Boudiccorn!  Way to go, super-smart listeners!

**Sarah:**  But here's the thing…Dave, Mira's unicorn, isn't exactly cooperating!  He's more interested in napping in the grooming basket than taking notes!

**Joe:**  Oh no!  Will Mira be able to give her presentation?  Imagine this:  Mira's standing in front of the class, ready to talk about Queen Boudiccorn, and Dave suddenly decides to do a…rumbling fart!

**(Sound effect: a comical fart sound)**

**Sarah:**  (Laughing) Oh, that's hilarious!  I can't wait to find out what happens next!

**Joe:**  Neither can we!  Join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"  We'll find out if Mira and Dave make history…or just make a mess!

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Sarah: Hey there, super listeners!  It’s Sarah here, ready to jump into the magical world of Unicorn School with Joe!  Joe, tell us more about Mira’s exciting first day!
[INFO] Joe: Woohoo! Mira’s super excited, Sarah!  It’s her first day at Unicorn School, and that’s way more exciting than just a regular Monday, right? Imagine waking up to a sparkly letter inviting you to a school where your best friend is a unicorn!
[INFO] Joe: Great question, Sarah!  Mira’s wondering that too! Maybe they like rainbow-colored cupcakes or shimmering sugar cubes? Or maybe they prefer moonbeams and stardust? We’ll find out what Mira picks at the supermarket!
[INFO] Sarah: A unicorn?! That’s amazing!  What kind of treats do you think unicorns like?  Do they like carrots like regular horses?  Or maybe something sparkly and magical?
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I can't wait!  Before we get to the supermarket, let's have a quick quiz! True or false: Unicorns can fly!
[INFO] Joe: Ooh, tricky one!  Let’s think…some stories say they can, but in Mira's world, we'll have to see!  We’ll find out more as the story goes on!  Let’s hear some guesses from our amazing listeners!
[INFO] Joe: I know what I’d do! I’d totally try to make a unicorn rainbow sundae!  With sprinkles of stardust, of course!
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly! Now, imagine this: You’re at Unicorn School. What’s the first magical thing you’d do?  Would you learn a spell?  Ride your unicorn on a rainbow?  Tell us your amazing ideas!
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds delicious!  Okay, back to Mira.  She’s at the supermarket with her mom and sister Rani.  Mira’s trying to decide what treats to get for her unicorn.  What do you think she should choose?  Should she get something healthy, like special unicorn hay? Or something sweet, like magical rainbow cookies?
[INFO] Joe: I bet unicorns love anything sparkly and shiny! Maybe some glittery apples or rainbow-colored carrots!  And maybe a giant lollipop that sparkles!  What do YOU think, listeners? Shout out your ideas!
[INFO] Sarah: Great ideas, Joe!  This is getting so exciting! I wonder what kind of unicorn Mira will get.  Will it be a fluffy one? A sparkly one? A unicorn with a rainbow mane?  It’s so exciting to think about what's waiting for Mira at Unicorn School!  We'll have to wait and see!
[INFO] Joe: That's right, Sarah!  And remember kids, stay tuned for more magical adventures with Mira at Unicorn School! Until next time, keep believing in magic!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super listeners! Welcome back to "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"  Today, we're diving headfirst into a magical mystery! Sarah, are you ready for some fantastical fun?
[INFO] Sarah: ** (Energetic and excited) Joe! I'm bursting with excitement!  Especially after that sneaky Rani trick!  Can you believe she left poor Mira to figure out the "Magic Portal" all by herself?!
[INFO] Joe: **  (Chuckles)  That Rani! She's a mischievous one, isn't she?  But hey, it led Mira to a new adventure!  Remember kids, sometimes the best adventures happen when we least expect them!  So, let's recap! Mira thought she had to jump in a bin, spin around, and scream to get to Unicorn School.  What a hilarious misunderstanding!
[INFO] Sarah: **  (Laughing) A bin?!  That's the silliest magic portal ever!  It’s like trying to get to a candy shop by climbing into a washing machine!
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly! It just goes to show that sometimes, things aren't always what they seem! So, Mira, instead of finding a magical portal, bumped into Raheem and his dad, who were *actually* about to use the *real* Magic Portal!
[INFO] Sarah: **  I bet Raheem was just as surprised as Mira!  Imagine, you're about to go to magic school, and BAM! You get tackled by a girl who just emerged from a wheelie bin!
[INFO] Joe: **  (Laughing) That's a great image, Sarah!  Kids, let's play a quick game!  If you were going to a magical school, what silly way would YOU think the entrance was?  Maybe a giant lollipop? A talking mailbox? Let your imaginations run wild!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, now that we've had some fun imagining, let's talk about real magic!  Or, in this case, the *real* Magic Portal. What do you think it might look like?  Is it sparkly? Does it shimmer? Does it smell like rainbows and cupcakes?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a great question, Sarah!  Maybe it's hidden in plain sight, like a secret doorway disguised as a tree! Or perhaps it's a shimmering pool of water that leads to another world!  What do YOU think, kids?
[INFO] Sarah: ** This whole situation reminds me of a riddle! Ready?  I have a door, but no key. I have a space, but no room. You can enter, but can't go outside. What am I?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's a clever one, Sarah!  The answer is a Magic Portal!  It has an entrance, but no exit in the traditional sense. It transports you to a different place entirely!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Exactly! And that’s just what happens to Mira, Raheem, and his dad. They find the real Magic Portal, and who knows what magical adventures await them on the other side!  Tune in next time to find out!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's all the time we have for today, kids!  Remember to keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"  Bye for now!
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super explorers! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Heeey everyone! Are you ready for another amazing adventure? Today, we're going to Unicorn School!  Can you believe it?!
[INFO] Joe: ** I know, right?! It's even more magical than a rainbow made of jellybeans! (Laughs)
[INFO] Sarah: ** Speaking of rainbows, remember how Mira and Raheem zoomed through one to get to Unicorn School?  It was a super speedy, sparkly ride!  Imagine that feeling – whoosh! – like flying on a fluffy cloud!
[INFO] Joe: **  And Unicorn School is HUGE!  It's got turrets, a clock tower, and even stables for the unicorns!  Did you know that unicorns don't like stairs? That's why the school is mostly one level!
[INFO] Sarah: **  That’s a very unicorn-y fact!  Now, quick trivia question: What do you think the unicorns use to kick the ball in their unicorn football game?
[INFO] Joe: **  Is it their noses? Their tails? Or their hooves?  Think hard!
[INFO] Sarah: ** The answer is… their hooves!  They're super talented athletes!
[INFO] Joe: **  And get this – some of the older unicorns can even FLY! Can you imagine riding a flying unicorn?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Imagine this! You're soaring high above the Fearsome Forest on your unicorn, the wind in your hair, and you spot a sparkly treasure chest below! What would you do?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's awesome!  Mira and Raheem are meeting their unicorns soon, and they start in Class Red, then move through the colors of the rainbow! What color do you think their badges will be next year?
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's right! It depends on what class they are in!  Amazing, isn't it?
[INFO] Joe: **  Unicorn School sounds like the most magical place ever! Remember kids, keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Heeeeeey everyone!  Ready for another amazing adventure?  Last time, we left Mira about to meet her very own unicorn at Unicorn School! Can you believe it?!
[INFO] Joe: ** I know, right?!  Unicorns!  Imagine having a sparkly, magical horse as your best friend!  Before we dive back into Mira's story, let's play a quick game!
[INFO] Joe: **  What has one horn and loves rainbows?
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's an easy one, Joe! A unicorn!
[INFO] Joe: ** You got it!  High five!  Okay,  let's get back to Mira's magical day!  Remember, kids, use your imaginations and picture this with me!
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, Mira and her classmates are in the Great Hall.  It's HUGE! Imagine a giant indoor field filled with wildflowers, and the most beautiful unicorns you've ever seen!
[INFO] Joe: **  Wow!  It sounds like a dream!  And there's a platform, like a stage, where Madame Shetland, the head teacher, is standing.  She's got scrolls and a clipboard – sounds official!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Super official! She's talking about the special bond between kids and unicorns.  It's a long tradition, she says, going back centuries!  Just imagine all the amazing unicorn stories from the past!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's incredible!  It's like a secret club of unicorn riders!  Speaking of secrets, here's a riddle for you, listeners:  I have a mane, but no hair. I have a horn, but no head. What am I?
[INFO] Sarah: **  A unicorn, of course!  The answer is a unicorn!
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely right!  You guys are super smart! Now, back to Mira! Madame Shetland is about to do something super exciting... she's about to help Mira find her very own unicorn best friend!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Oh my gosh, I can't wait to find out what happens!  Imagine the excitement!  What color do you think Mira's unicorn will be, listeners?  Let us know in the comments!
[INFO] Joe: **  And remember kids, keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey adventurers! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hi everyone! Are you ready for another super-duper exciting episode?
[INFO] Joe: ** Today, we're diving headfirst into the magical world of unicorns! Remember Mira and her friends at Unicorn School?
[INFO] Sarah: ** Oh my gosh, yes!  Last time, they were about to meet their very own unicorns!  It was SO exciting!  Remember Jake and his super cool show jumping unicorn, Pegasus?
[INFO] Joe: ** And Darcy with her sparkly silver unicorn!  And Seb with his rainbow-maned Firework!
[INFO] Sarah: **  And Raheem… oh boy, Raheem's unicorn was a BIG surprise!  It was a HUGE, midnight-blue blur!  Remember kids, what do you think made the floor shake when Raheem's unicorn arrived? Let's have a guess!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a great question! Maybe it was the unicorn's super-powerful hooves? Or maybe it was magic!  What do YOU think?  Let us know in the comments!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Now, imagine this! You're at Unicorn School too, and it's YOUR turn to meet your unicorn. What color would it be? What would its name be?  Would it have a special talent?
[INFO] Joe: **  Speaking of talents, did you know that unicorns aren't just about magic and rainbows?  They're super smart too! Just like how your brain helps you learn and solve puzzles, a unicorn's horn might have special powers, like healing plants or even creating rainbows!
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's right! It's like a unicorn's horn is a super-powered antenna for magic!  And just like how your body needs healthy food to grow strong, unicorns need special flowers and sparkling water to keep their magic strong.
[INFO] Joe: ** Here's a fun fact! Unicorns love riddles!  Let's try one: I have a horn, but I'm not a rhino. I'm magical, but I'm not a fairy. What am I?
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's right, it's a unicorn!
[INFO] Joe: **  Great job, everyone!  Now, remember, just like unicorns show kindness, bravery, and friendship, we should too!  Being kind to others is like giving them a sparkling rainbow of happiness!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly! And being brave is like galloping towards your dreams, even if they seem a little scary at first!
[INFO] Joe: **  So, keep believing in magic, keep your imaginations soaring, and join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hi everyone! Are you ready for another amazing adventure?  Last time, Mira finally got her unicorn… but it wasn't exactly what she expected! Remember Dave? The slightly… *ahem*…  chunky unicorn with a surprise talent for… well, let's just say leaving his mark!
[INFO] Joe: ** (Laughing)  A real *pooper* of a situation!  Get it?  A pooper?  Because of the… you know…
[INFO] Sarah: ** (Laughing)  Okay, Joe!  Let's not dwell on the details!  So, Mira and Dave are in Unicorn School, and it’s anything but ordinary!  Imagine a classroom with regular desks AND giant desks for unicorns, complete with hay bags and grooming kits!
[INFO] Joe: **  It’s like a regular school, but with extra magic and… uh…  poo!  Speaking of which, did you know that unicorn poo is actually… (whispers dramatically) …rainbow-colored?
[INFO] Sarah: **  (Gasps playfully)  Joe!  Don't make things up!  Though, that would be amazing! But in Mira's case, it was more brown than rainbow!
[INFO] Joe: **  Okay, okay!  Let's get back to the story. Mira's got a challenge on her hands!  Dave's being a bit… stubborn.  What do you think she should do to get him to cooperate?  Should she bribe him with extra hay?  Sing him a unicorn lullaby?  Maybe tickle his tummy?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Great questions!  Maybe a combination of all three?  What do *you* think, listeners?  Let us know on our website!  But in the story, Mira and Raheem worked together to get Dave to class! Teamwork makes the dream work, right?
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely!  Teamwork is super important, just like the different parts of a plant working together to grow!  The roots are like the teamwork, the stem supports the leaves, and the leaves create food for the whole plant.  It's all connected!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Speaking of connections, here's a fun fact!  Did you know that some animals communicate using sounds we can't even hear?  It's like a secret animal language!
[INFO] Joe: **  Wow, that's amazing!  Imagine if we could understand what our pets were really saying!
[INFO] Sarah: **  It would be so cool! We could even ask Dave what he wants for a snack!
[INFO] Joe: ** That's a great idea! Maybe Dave wants some extra special unicorn doughnuts?
[INFO] Sarah: ** Maybe!  We'll have to find out next time!  Join us then for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, adventurers! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!
[INFO] Joe: ** You bet! Last time, Mira and her unicorn, Dave, were having a bit of a… *ahem*… bumpy start to their unicorn school lessons! Remember?
[INFO] Sarah: ** Oh yeah! Dave wasn't exactly thrilled about getting groomed!  He was more interested in… doughnuts!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Heeey everyone!  Ready for another super-duper exciting episode?
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly!  And Mira accidentally brought doughnuts instead of carrots!  A total unicorn-treat disaster! But wait, there's more!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Mira was feeling pretty down, but then… Dave had a doughnut-powered transformation! He went from grumpy to giggly in a flash!
[INFO] Joe: **  It was like magic!  But then… *bam*! Dave got a little *too* excited and caused a bit of a classroom commotion!  Oops!
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, what do you think happened next?  Was Mira in trouble? Did Miss Glitterhorn get mad?  Let's hear some guesses from our awesome listeners!
[INFO] Joe: **  That's right, adventurers! Send us your guesses!  Maybe Dave learned a valuable lesson about eating too many doughnuts? Or maybe Miss Glitterhorn has a secret stash of extra-delicious unicorn treats?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Or maybe… just maybe… Dave discovered a hidden talent! Like, maybe he's secretly a doughnut-powered acrobat? Imagine that!
[INFO] Joe: **  Imagine Dave doing a doughnut-fueled backflip! Or maybe a doughnut-balancing act on his horn!  That would be amazing!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, listeners, let's have a quick quiz! What is one thing you should *never* do to your unicorn, according to Unicorn School Rule 3?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's right, you should *never* bribe your unicorn!  Remember, friendship and trust are the most important magic of all!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  And we'll find out what happened next in Mira's amazing unicorn adventure next time!  Join us then for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"
[INFO] Joe: ** Hey there, super-duper listeners! Welcome back to Adventures with Joe and Sarah!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Hi everyone! Are you ready for another exciting adventure? Today, we're diving headfirst into the magical world of…unicorns!
[INFO] Joe: **  Woohoo! Unicorns!  But not just any unicorns, Sarah.  These are history-making, note-taking, maybe-a-little-mischievous unicorns!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly! Remember Mira and her unicorn, Dave, from last time?  Dave was… well, let's just say he wasn't the most well-behaved unicorn in Unicorn School.
[INFO] Joe: **  He was more of a…doughnut-loving, classroom-galloping, havoc-causing unicorn!  Remember the matchstick castle?
[INFO] Sarah: **  Oh boy!  Poor Grace Hobbs!  But today, Mira's facing a new challenge: History class!  And Mr. Trotsky is teaching about famous unicorns throughout history!
[INFO] Joe: **  Can you believe it?  Unicorns in history! Imagine a unicorn painter like Unicornardo da Vinci!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Or a super-fat unicorn king with six wives!  King Henry the Neighth, but with a horn!  Hee hee!
[INFO] Joe: **  And get this – a unicorn prime minister! Winst-horn Churchill!  That's a pun, kids!  It's funny because it sounds like Winston Churchill!
[INFO] Sarah: **  High five, Joe!  And the best part?  Mira has to give a presentation about a famous unicorn!  That's a big responsibility!
[INFO] Joe: **  Hey, listeners!  Quick trivia question! Which famous unicorn was a magnificent Celtic warrior queen?  Is it A) Unicornardo da Vinci, B) King Henry the Neighth, or C) Queen Boudiccorn?
[INFO] Sarah: ** You got it! Think carefully and shout out your answer!
[INFO] Joe: ** The answer is C) Queen Boudiccorn!  Way to go, super-smart listeners!
[INFO] Sarah: **  But here's the thing…Dave, Mira's unicorn, isn't exactly cooperating!  He's more interested in napping in the grooming basket than taking notes!
[INFO] Joe: **  Oh no!  Will Mira be able to give her presentation?  Imagine this:  Mira's standing in front of the class, ready to talk about Queen Boudiccorn, and Dave suddenly decides to do a…rumbling fart!
[INFO] Sarah: **  (Laughing) Oh, that's hilarious!  I can't wait to find out what happens next!
[INFO] Joe: **  Neither can we!  Join us next time for more "Adventures with Joe and Sarah!"  We'll find out if Mira and Dave make history…or just make a mess!

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Hey kids! Welcome to Podify Kids, where we make learning super fun and exciting! Get ready for cool stories, awesome facts, and tons of laughs as we explore the world together!

**Joe:** Hey Sarah! Ready for a super-duper scientific adventure today?

**Sarah:**  Absolutely, Joe!  Is it going to involve exploding volcanoes or maybe talking animals?

**Joe:**  Even better! Today's adventure is all about tiny detectives called antibodies! They're like super-small superheroes that help scientists solve mysteries in the body. Imagine them as tiny little magnets that stick ONLY to specific things.

**Sarah:** Magnets! I love magnets!  So, what mystery are these tiny superhero magnets solving?

**Joe:** Well, scientists use these antibody magnets to find specific proteins in our bodies. Proteins are like tiny building blocks that make everything work.  One scientist, Carl, was studying a special protein that's connected to a tricky disease. But, he found that many of the antibody magnets weren't working properly! They were sticking to the wrong things, like a magnet that sticks to wood instead of metal!

**Sarah:**  Oh no! That’s like trying to find your favorite toy in a messy room and your magnet keeps sticking to everything BUT your toy! That's a big problem!

**Joe:** Exactly! It's like trying to find a specific LEGO brick in a giant pile of LEGOs, but your special LEGO-finding tool keeps grabbing the wrong pieces!  It wasted a lot of time and resources!

**Sarah:** So, what did Carl do?

**Joe:** Carl and his friends decided to test ALL the antibody magnets. They found that out of 16, only THREE worked correctly!  And guess what?  Lots of scientists had used the *wrong* magnets in their experiments, and published their results!

**Sarah:** Wow! That's a lot of messed-up experiments!  That’s like building a really cool LEGO castle, but using the wrong colored bricks!

**Joe:**  Exactly!  So, now scientists are working together to create a better system. They're testing all the antibody magnets to make sure they're working correctly. It's like having a super-powered LEGO quality control team!  They are making sure all the bricks are the right color and shape before they are used to build something!

**Sarah:**  That's amazing! So, it's like a big science cleanup project!  A bit like cleaning up my room, but much more important!

**Joe:**  Exactly! And it's showing us how important it is to double-check our tools and make sure they're working correctly!  It's a great example of how scientists work together to solve problems and make sure their experiments are accurate.

**Sarah:**  This is super cool, Joe!  I never knew antibodies could be so tricky!

**Joe:** That's the fun of science, Sarah! It's full of surprises and exciting discoveries!

**(Sound effect: Upbeat music fades in and out)**

**Joe:**  And now for a quick quiz! What are antibodies like?

**(Pause for answer)**

**Joe:** That’s right! They are like tiny magnets that help scientists find specific things in the body!  Great job, everyone!  Join us next time for more fun facts and amazing adventures on Podify Kids!  Bye bye!

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 **(Sound of playful jungle music intro)**

**Joe:** Hey everyone, and welcome back to Podify Kids! I'm Joe!

**Sarah:** And I'm Sarah! Ready for another amazing adventure?

**Joe:** You bet! Today, we're going on a microscopic safari!  We'll be exploring the amazing world of… antibodies!

**Sarah:**  (Gasps dramatically) Antibodies!  Sounds super-duper scientific!  But don't worry, we'll make it fun! Imagine antibodies as tiny superheroes, zooming around inside our bodies, fighting off villains like germs!

**Joe:** Exactly! They're like tiny little bodyguards, super specific about who they catch!  Think of them like…  special delivery robots!  They only deliver their packages (fighting off the bad guys!) to the *exact* right address (the germs!).

**Sarah:**  Wow!  That's a great analogy, Joe! So, sometimes these superhero antibodies don't always get the delivery right, right?

**Sarah:** It's like a superhero quality control team!  They test the antibodies to see if they're really as super as they claim to be! This team is called YCharOS, and they’re amazing! They test tons of antibodies to make sure they work properly.  They even got help from antibody companies!

**Joe:**  Wow! That's teamwork!  It's like when we work together to build the best Lego castle ever!

**(Sound of playful Lego clicking)**

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And guess what?  YCharOS discovered that some antibodies weren't working as well as they should!  It's like finding a broken piece in our Lego castle!

**Joe:**  Oh no! But they fixed it, right?

**Sarah:**  They sure did!  The companies made changes, and some even took the faulty antibodies off the market! It's like replacing the broken Lego piece with a new one!

**Joe:**  That's awesome!  So, even superheroes need a little help sometimes!  Now, for a quick quiz! What are antibodies like, according to our amazing analogy?

**(Sound of a playful quiz buzzer)**

**Sarah:**  A) Tiny, grumpy gremlins.  B) Super-specific delivery robots. C) Giant, friendly elephants.

**Joe:**  Think carefully, kids!  The answer is… B!  Super-specific delivery robots!  Great job, everyone!

**Sarah:**  And there are other teams like OMAPs, who are testing antibodies in different ways, making sure they work perfectly in different situations! It’s like testing our Lego castle in the rain, or in the wind, to see if it holds up!


**Joe:** That's right, Sarah!  It's all about making sure these tiny superheroes are always ready to fight off those pesky germs!

**Sarah:**  So next time you feel a little under the weather, remember those amazing antibody superheroes working hard inside you!

**Joe:**  That’s right! And remember to listen again next time for more fun facts and amazing adventures on Podify Kids! Bye bye!

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** Hi everyone, and welcome back to Podify Kids! I'm Sarah!

**Joe:** And I'm Joe!  Ready for another amazing adventure?

**Sarah:** You bet! Today, we're going on a super-duper science expedition!  Imagine we’re shrinking down to the size of ants and exploring the amazing world inside a leaf!

**Joe:** Whoa! That sounds tiny!  But before we shrink, let's play a quick game. What has an eye, but cannot see?

**(Sound of a playful chime)**

**Sarah:**  I know that one! A needle!

**Joe:**  Correct!  You're a super scientist already! Now, let's shrink!  (Sound effect: shrinking sound)

**Sarah:**  Wow, look at all these amazing cells!  They’re like tiny building blocks making up the leaf! Some of them are green because they have chlorophyll – that’s what helps the plant make its food using sunshine! It’s like a tiny solar panel!

**Joe:**  Exactly! And scientists use special tools, like super-powered magnifying glasses, to see these tiny things.  They even have special "sticky notes" called antibodies!

**Sarah:**  Sticky notes?!  What do they stick to?

**Joe:**  They stick to special parts of the cells, like little flags marking important things!  Scientists use these "sticky notes" to learn all about how plants work, and even how our bodies work!  It’s like a secret code that helps them understand the amazing world around us.

**Sarah:**  Imagine this: We’re using our super-tiny sticky notes to find a special protein inside the leaf cell. It's like finding a hidden treasure!  If we find it, we know the plant is healthy and strong!

**Joe:**  That's right! And sometimes scientists use different tools to check if their "sticky notes" are working correctly. It's like double-checking your work to make sure you're on the right track!

**Sarah:**  It's like making sure your spaceship is fueled up before blasting off to explore a new planet!

**Joe:**  Perfect analogy! Now, before we grow back to our normal size, here’s a quick quiz! What helps a plant make its food using sunshine?

**(Sound of a playful chime)**

**Sarah:** Chlorophyll!

**Joe:** You got it!  We're growing back now! (Sound effect: growing sound)

**Sarah:**  Wow, that was fun!

**Joe:** Thanks for hanging out with us, kids! Remember, learning is an adventure, and there’s so much more to discover. Don’t forget to share Podify Kids with your friends and family. See you next time for more fun and excitement—bye for now!

[INFO] Sarah: ** Magnets! I love magnets!  So, what mystery are these tiny superhero magnets solving?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, scientists use these antibody magnets to find specific proteins in our bodies. Proteins are like tiny building blocks that make everything work.  One scientist, Carl, was studying a special protein that's connected to a tricky disease. But, he found that many of the antibody magnets weren't working properly! They were sticking to the wrong things, like a magnet that sticks to wood instead of metal!
[INFO] Sarah: **  Oh no! That’s like trying to find your favorite toy in a messy room and your magnet keeps sticking to everything BUT your toy! That's a big problem!
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly! It's like trying to find a specific LEGO brick in a giant pile of LEGOs, but your special LEGO-finding tool keeps grabbing the wrong pieces!  It wasted a lot of time and resources!
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, what did Carl do?
[INFO] Joe: ** Carl and his friends decided to test ALL the antibody magnets. They found that out of 16, only THREE worked correctly!  And guess what?  Lots of scientists had used the *wrong* magnets in their experiments, and published their results!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Wow! That's a lot of messed-up experiments!  That’s like building a really cool LEGO castle, but using the wrong colored bricks!
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly!  So, now scientists are working together to create a better system. They're testing all the antibody magnets to make sure they're working correctly. It's like having a super-powered LEGO quality control team!  They are making sure all the bricks are the right color and shape before they are used to build something!
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's amazing! So, it's like a big science cleanup project!  A bit like cleaning up my room, but much more important!

Beyond its historical and academic reputation, Boston is celebrated for its thriving arts scene, diverse culinary offerings, passionate sports culture, and picturesque neighborhoods like Beacon Hill and Back Bay. Whether exploring its cobblestone streets or waterfront, Boston offers a rich and dynamic experience for residents and visitors alike.

Sarah: Wow, Joe, you've painted a pretty idyllic picture of Boston!  It sounds amazing.  I've always wanted to go, but I'm picturing it as maybe a little…stuffy?  Like, all history and no fun.  Is that a fair assessment, or am I completely off base?

Joe:  (laughs)  I think you're falling into a common stereotype!  While the history is undeniably a huge part of Boston's charm – and honestly, walking the Freedom Trail is incredible – the city is far from stuffy.  It's got a really energetic, almost rebellious spirit, which makes sense given its revolutionary past.  Think vibrant street art scenes, incredible food trucks serving everything from lobster rolls to gourmet dumplings, and a music scene that’s constantly evolving.

Sarah:  Okay, so lobster rolls and dumplings…I'm sold!  (laughs)  What about the people?  What's the vibe like?  Are Bostonians known for being particularly friendly, or…competitive, given the whole sports rivalry thing?

Joe:  That's a great question!  Bostonians definitely have a reputation – and rightfully so – for being passionate about their sports teams.  But I'd say they're generally friendly and welcoming, especially to tourists.  Maybe a little…reserved at first, but once you break the ice, you'll find them to be very engaging and opinionated, which I find endearing.  And yes,  the sports rivalries are intense, but it's all part of the fun!  You'll see people wearing their team colors with pride, and the atmosphere during a game is electric.

Sarah:  So, if someone was planning a trip to Boston, what are some must-do things beyond the obvious historical sites?  Give me some hidden gems, or maybe some unique experiences.

Joe:  Well, beyond the Freedom Trail, I'd highly recommend exploring the North End, Boston's Little Italy.  The aroma alone is worth the trip!  Grab some cannoli, wander the charming streets, and maybe even catch a glimpse of the oldest public park in America, Boston Common.  For something a little different, check out the Museum of Fine Arts, which has an incredible collection, or take a harbor cruise for stunning city views.  And if you're there in the fall, the foliage is breathtaking.

Sarah:  Perfect!  Sounds like a trip to Boston is definitely in order. Thanks for painting such a vivid picture, Joe.  I think we've convinced a lot of our listeners to add it to their travel bucket list!


Joe: My pleasure, Sarah! And to our listeners, thanks for joining us on Podify.  We hope you enjoyed this little journey to Boston.  Join us next time for another fascinating exploration!

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Podify, where we explore fascinating topics and stories from around the world. Join us for an engaging and insightful journey through ideas that connect us all!  Today, we're talking about Boston – a city that truly has it all.

Joe: Boston, the capital of Massachusetts and one of the oldest cities in the United States, is a vibrant blend of historical significance and modern innovation. Known as the "Cradle of Liberty," Boston played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, with iconic sites like the Freedom Trail, Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum, and Paul Revere's House drawing millions of visitors annually. The city is also a hub for higher education, boasting world-renowned institutions such as Harvard University and MIT in nearby Cambridge. Beyond its historical and academic reputation, Boston is celebrated for its thriving arts scene, diverse culinary offerings, passionate sports culture, and picturesque neighborhoods like Beacon Hill and Back Bay. Whether exploring its cobblestone streets or waterfront, Boston offers a rich and dynamic experience for residents and visitors alike.  So, Sarah, what are your thoughts? Have you ever been to Boston?

Sarah:  I have!  And honestly, Joe, it completely lived up to the hype.  I went a few years ago with my family, and I was blown away by the history.  I mean, walking the Freedom Trail felt like stepping back in time.  It was amazing to see the Old North Church and imagine Paul Revere's ride – it really brought the history books to life.  But it wasn't just history; we also had incredible clam chowder (I'm still dreaming about it!), explored some really cool art galleries in the North End, and even caught a Red Sox game – the atmosphere was electric!  It's such a fascinating mix of old and new.  What surprised *you* most about Boston when you visited, or even from your research for today?

Joe:  That's fantastic!  The clam chowder is definitely a highlight for many. For me, it was the unexpected blend of historical grandeur and modern energy.  I expected the historical sites to be impressive, which they were, but I was surprised by how seamlessly that history is integrated into the city's modern life.  You see these beautiful old buildings alongside cutting-edge technology companies and vibrant street art.  It's not a clash; it's a really interesting juxtaposition.  And I have to say, the walk along the Charles River is breathtaking.  It’s such a beautiful and peaceful escape from the bustling city center.  Did you manage to get out to the Charles River?

Sarah: Absolutely! We rented a swan boat – a bit touristy, I’ll admit, but so much fun!  And paddling along the river, with the city skyline as a backdrop, was truly memorable.  It's a perfect example of how Boston offers something for everyone, whether you’re a history buff, a foodie, an art lover, or just someone looking for a scenic stroll.  Speaking of food, did you try any of the famous Boston baked beans?  I heard they're…legendary.

Joe: (Laughing) Legendary is one word for it!  I did, and I have to admit, they were quite…unique.  Let's just say my taste buds had an adventure.  But that's part of the fun of exploring a new city, isn't it?  Embracing the unexpected, trying new things, and creating memories.  And Boston certainly delivers on that front.

Sarah: Exactly! It's a city that truly rewards exploration, and I think it's a great example of how history and modernity can coexist and even enhance each other.  It's a city with a strong identity, but also incredibly welcoming and diverse.  I'd definitely go back in a heartbeat.

Joe:  I think that sums it up perfectly, Sarah.  Boston: a city of history, innovation, delicious food, and unforgettable experiences.  Thanks for joining me on this exploration today!  And to our listeners, we hope you’ll consider adding Boston to your travel list!  That's all for this episode of Podify.  Join us next time for another fascinating journey!

Sarah: Wow, Joe, that’s quite the introduction! You’ve painted a pretty picture.  It sounds amazing.  Um, I've always wanted to go to Boston.  I mean, the history alone is incredible.  The Boston Tea Party... I remember learning about that in school, and it just seemed so… dramatic!  Throwing tea into the harbor!  Can you imagine the chaos?

Joe:  (chuckles)  Total chaos!  And you know, it's not just the big, dramatic events. It's the little things too.  Walking along the Freedom Trail, you can almost feel the weight of history under your feet.  Those cobblestone streets… they've seen it all, haven't they?  I remember one time, I was walking along and stumbled upon this tiny little alleyway, completely unexpected, and it just felt like I'd stepped back in time.

Sarah: Oh, I love that!  Those hidden gems are the best.  And you mentioned the food.  Clam chowder and lobster rolls... I’m already hungry!  But beyond the historical sites and the delicious food, what's the vibe like in Boston? Is it a fast-paced city, or is there a more relaxed atmosphere?

Joe:  It's a bit of a mix, actually.  It's definitely a bustling city, especially around the universities and the financial district.  But there's also a surprisingly relaxed feel in some neighborhoods.  You can find quiet little parks and charming cafes where you can just sit and people-watch. And the Charles River…  taking a walk or a bike ride along there is incredibly peaceful.

Sarah: That sounds perfect.  A good balance of energy and relaxation.  And, of course,  Fenway Park! I’ve seen pictures, and it just looks… iconic.  Even if you're not a huge baseball fan, it seems like a must-see.

Joe: Absolutely!  It's a piece of American history, and the atmosphere there is electric, even on a regular game day.  Plus, you know,  the hot dogs are legendary.  (laughs)

Sarah:  (laughs)  Well, you’ve definitely convinced me. Boston is officially on my travel list!  Thanks for the wonderful overview, Joe.  This has been a great start to the podcast.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah! And for our listeners,  we'll be back next week with another fascinating topic. Until then, keep exploring!

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a really fascinating – and frankly, a bit frustrating – area of biomedical research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies and how scientists are trying to fix it.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this reproducibility crisis.  Is this what you're talking about?  Like, scientists get results, but then other labs can't replicate them?

Joe:  Exactly.  And a huge part of that, um, it seems, is down to these antibodies.  See,  Carl Laflamme, this researcher, he was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, right?  The gene is called C9ORF72.  He needed antibodies to, you know, find and measure this protein in cells.  But the problem was... well,  there was a real mess. He started looking at existing research papers, and... there was no agreement on where this protein even *was* in the cell.

Sarah: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, what was the problem with the antibodies?  Were they just... bad?

Joe:  Yeah, that's kind of the short answer, but it's more nuanced than that.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies – these are the ones scientists buy from companies – all supposedly designed to bind to this specific protein.  And only three actually worked properly.  They bound to the target protein *without* binding to other things in the cell.  The other thirteen, they were basically useless for his research.

Sarah:  So, fifteen out of sixteen? That’s a shockingly low success rate.  And these were commercially available antibodies?  I mean, these are supposed to be reliable tools.

Joe:  Exactly! And it gets worse.  He found that about fifteen published papers used one of the *bad* antibodies – the one that didn't even bind to the right protein! And those papers had been cited over 3,000 times.  Think about the wasted time, resources, and potentially, the misleading conclusions based on faulty data.  It's a huge problem.

Sarah:  Three thousand citations...That's...mind-boggling. So, what's being done to fix this?  Besides, you know, just being more careful?

Joe:  Well, there are several initiatives springing up.  One is called iCharOS –  that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science – and it aims to characterize *every* human protein antibody commercially available.  It's a massive undertaking, but it could really change things.  There's also a push to create better antibodies, make it easier to find reliable ones, and encourage best practices in the field.  It’s a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah:  It sounds like a huge collaborative effort is needed to solve this.  It's not just one person or one company that can fix this, is it?

Joe:  Absolutely.  It's a systemic issue.  Um, it's a bit like, you know, building a house with faulty bricks. You can't expect a strong structure if your foundation is weak.  This is the foundation of a lot of biological research, and it's been shaky for far too long.  But there’s hope.  People are realizing the scale of the problem, and they’re actively trying to fix it.  It's a slow process, but hopefully, we're moving in the right direction.

The gene is called C9ORF72.  He needed antibodies to, you know, find and measure this protein in cells.  But the problem was... well,  there was a real mess. He started looking at existing research papers, and... there was no agreement on where this protein even *was* in the cell."

He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies – these are the ones scientists buy from companies – all supposedly designed to bind to this specific protein.

It’s a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers."

**Previous Context**:
Absolutely.  It's a systemic issue.  Um, it's a bit like, you know, building a house with faulty bricks. You can't expect a strong structure if your foundation is weak.  This is the foundation of a lot of biological research, and it's been shaky for far too long.  But there’s hope.  People are realizing the scale of the problem, and they’re actively trying to fix it.  It's a slow process, but hopefully, we're moving in the right direction.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, you've laid out a pretty compelling case for the need for antibody validation, particularly with the YCharOS initiative.  The sheer scale of the problem – millions of antibodies, many of which are, frankly, unreliable – is staggering.  It's not just about individual researchers making mistakes; it's a systemic issue in how these reagents are produced and distributed.

Sarah:  Exactly. And it's not just about the sheer number, it's also about the lack of standardized testing, isn't it?  I mean,  YCharOS is a great example of a collaborative effort to address this, but it highlights how much work there still is to do.  They've tested over a thousand antibodies, and a significant portion didn't perform as advertised. That's... alarming, to say the least.

Joe:  Absolutely alarming.  The problem stems from a few key areas.  First, the manufacturing process itself.  Many antibody suppliers, understandably, prioritize speed and volume over rigorous characterization.  They might perform some basic tests, but the level of scrutiny often isn’t sufficient to guarantee reliability across various applications.  Second, the lack of standardized validation protocols means that different labs might use different methods, making it difficult to compare results.  And third, the issue of context, as Cecilia Williams points out.  An antibody might work perfectly in one cell line, but fail miserably in another.

Sarah:  Right, and that brings us to the OMAPs initiative, which takes a different approach. They focus on a single application—multiplex imaging—but across multiple contexts, different tissues and imaging methods.  It’s almost the inverse of YCharOS’s approach.  Is one inherently better than the other?  Or are they complementary?

Joe:  They're complementary, I think.  YCharOS provides a more rigorous, standardized characterization in a specific context.  This gives researchers a baseline level of confidence.  OMAPs, on the other hand, tackles the issue of context-dependent performance.  It relies on community validation, which, while potentially less rigorous in terms of standardized methodology, provides a broader range of real-world application data.  You could argue that OMAPs is more about practical application validation, while YCharOS focuses on fundamental performance characterization.

Sarah: So, it's a two-pronged approach. One focuses on the core functionality of the antibody, the other on its performance within different research settings. That's... elegant, actually.  But it still leaves a huge gap, right?  We're talking about millions of antibodies.  Even with these initiatives, it seems like a drop in the ocean.

Joe: You're right. It's a monumental task.  However, these initiatives are setting important precedents.  They're demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale antibody validation, pushing for better standards, and fostering collaboration between researchers, vendors, and funding agencies. It's a slow burn, but progress is being made.  And the awareness is growing, which is crucial.  The more researchers understand the limitations of commercially available antibodies, the more likely they are to demand higher standards and incorporate rigorous validation into their own work.

Sarah:  It really does highlight the importance of skepticism and careful experimental design, doesn't it?  We can't just blindly trust the catalogue.  We need to be critical consumers of these reagents.  It's a crucial lesson for the entire field.

It really does highlight the importance of skepticism and careful experimental design, doesn't it?  We can't just blindly trust the catalogue.  We need to be critical consumers of these reagents.  It's a crucial lesson for the entire field.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah:  So, Joe, that whole section about antibodies… it’s a real mess, isn't it?  It sounds like a huge problem for reproducibility in research.

Joe: Yeah, it's a bigger problem than most people realize.  Um, you know,  the issue is multifaceted.  First, there's the sheer difficulty of finding the right antibodies.  The article mentioned that 90% of antibodies cited in one journal lacked catalogue numbers. That's… astonishing.  It makes repeating experiments incredibly hard.

Sarah:  Ninety percent!  Wow. So, what’s the solution then? Just better record keeping?

Joe:  Partly.  The RRIDs, research resource identifiers, are a step in the right direction.  They provide unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other resources, solving the problem of catalogue numbers disappearing or being duplicated.  It's a system for tracking them, essentially.  Think of it like a permanent, universal product code, but for scientific reagents.

Sarah:  Okay, so that helps with *finding* the antibodies, but what about knowing if they’re *actually any good*?  The article mentioned CiteAb… is that the solution to that?

Joe:  CiteAb is a helpful resource, it's a search engine that aggregates information on antibody citations, and increasingly, validation data.  It helps researchers see which antibodies are frequently used, suggesting they might be reliable. But, and this is a big but,  a high citation count doesn't automatically mean an antibody is good.  Many factors influence citation frequency that have nothing to do with accuracy.

Sarah:  Right, publication bias and all that.  So, even with CiteAb, there’s no guarantee of quality.  What about this "knock-out validation"? The article mentioned it.

Joe:  Knock-out validation is essentially confirming the antibody's specificity by using a genetically modified organism lacking the target protein. If the antibody doesn't bind in the absence of the target, it's more likely to be specific. It's considered the gold standard, but… less than 5% of antibodies are validated this way.

Sarah:  So, we’re relying on a system where most antibodies lack proper identification, and even when they're found, there's no guarantee of quality.  It sounds…  depressing.  What are people doing about it?

Joe:  Well, there's a growing awareness of the problem. The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is a good example. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders—the whole ecosystem—to try and improve things.  It's a collaborative effort to address the problem from multiple angles.  It's a very complex issue, so a multi-pronged approach is needed.

Sarah:  It's definitely a huge challenge. It really does underscore the need for transparency and rigorous validation in scientific research.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It's a lot to take in.


Joe:  No problem, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, and it's important to discuss it.  Hopefully, initiatives like OGA can help make a real difference in the future.

No problem, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, and it's important to discuss it.  Hopefully, initiatives like OGA can help make a real difference in the future.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe:  Right, so where were we? Ah yes, OGA and the push for better antibody reliability.  It's a multifaceted problem, isn't it?  The core issue boils down to reproducibility.  Historically, many antibodies were generated using hybridoma technology – basically, fusing immune cells to create immortalized cell lines that produce antibodies.  The problem is, these hybridomas can be unstable, leading to batch-to-batch variation in antibody production.  Each batch might have slightly different properties, affecting experimental results.

Sarah: So, that's why the shift towards recombinant antibodies is so significant?  It sounds like a simpler, more controlled process.

Joe: Exactly. Recombinant antibodies are produced using genetically engineered cells programmed to produce a specific antibody sequence.  This eliminates the inherent variability of the hybridoma method.  You get a consistent product, batch after batch.  It's a much more standardized process, leading to greater reproducibility in research.  Think of it like this... well, no, let's not use an analogy.  It's simply a difference in the *method* of production, leading to vastly improved consistency.

Sarah:  Makes sense.  But even with recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to validate them, right?  It's not a magic bullet?

Joe:  Precisely.  Even with recombinant technology, validation is crucial.  There's always the possibility of errors in the genetic engineering process, or the antibody might not bind to the target protein as expected.  Independent validation is a critical step to ensure the reliability of any antibody, regardless of its production method.  That’s why initiatives like OGA are so important; they’re pushing for better practices and data sharing to help researchers make informed choices.

Sarah:  So, the OGA community is working on making it easier to find and use validated antibodies.  And they're also trying to incentivize researchers to use best practices, which is... interesting.  It's not just a technical problem, it's a behavioral one too.  Scientists might be hesitant to change their habits, even if there's evidence that a certain antibody is unreliable.

Joe:  You're absolutely right.  It's a cultural shift that's needed, as much as a technological one.  There's inertia, and sometimes researchers are reluctant to abandon antibodies they've been using for years, even if there are better alternatives available.  The incentives offered by OGA and others are a crucial part of overcoming that inertia.  It's about creating a system where using validated antibodies becomes the norm, not the exception.  And, you know, sometimes it's just a matter of making good data readily available and easily accessible.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of technology, incentives, and community effort.  It sounds like a huge undertaking.  But the potential payoff – more reliable research – is huge as well.  It makes a real difference to the research process.

Joe:  Absolutely.  And it's not just about the research itself; it's about the downstream consequences.  More reliable results translate to better drug development, more effective therapies, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.  It's a long game, but a very important one.

 (Sound of a gentle throat clearing)

Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about validating antibodies.  You mentioned immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Um, can you break those down a little more for our listeners?  I mean, I’ve heard the terms, but… they sound a bit intimidating.

Joe:  Yeah, they sound worse than they are, honestly.  Immunohistochemistry, or IHC, is basically like staining cells. You've got a sample of cells, right? And you use an antibody – that's, you know, a protein that specifically binds to another protein – to see if a particular protein is present in those cells.  If the antibody binds, it shows up as a color change, indicating the protein is there.  It's a pretty visual method.

Sarah: So, it's like... a highlighter for proteins?  A very specific highlighter, though.

Joe:  I guess you could say that, yeah.  A very, very specific highlighter. It's more precise than that, but for a basic understanding, that works.  Western blotting is different.  It's used to confirm the antibody binds to the *correct* protein. You separate proteins by size, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size. Think of it like… um…  okay, forget the analogy. It’s a different technique entirely.  You get a band on a gel, and the position of that band tells you the molecular weight. If it's where you expect it, then your antibody is targeting the right protein.

Sarah: Okay, so IHC shows *where* the protein is, and Western blotting shows *what* protein it is?  Is that a fair summary?

Joe:  Pretty much.  And then immunoprecipitation… that's a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally pull out the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it as fishing with a very specific bait – the antibody.  Then, you can analyze what you've caught using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  It’s a more definitive way of proving that your antibody is really binding to what it's supposed to.

Sarah:  Right. So, you're using multiple techniques to be absolutely sure.  It sounds like a pretty rigorous process.  And I guess, as you mentioned earlier, this reliability is crucial for all the downstream applications.

Joe: Absolutely.  Getting it wrong at this stage means everything else could be wrong. It cascades down.  It’s a bit like building a house; if the foundation is weak, the whole thing is at risk.  Though, again, I'm trying to avoid analogies...

Sarah: (laughs)  I understand.  It's just helpful sometimes to picture things.  So, this validation process is really the cornerstone of reliable research.  It’s not just about publishing a paper; it's about ensuring the accuracy of the entire scientific process.

Joe: Exactly.  It's about building trust and confidence in the results.  And that trust is essential for everything from drug development to diagnostics.  Without reliable antibodies, we're essentially working in the dark.

Sarah:  That's a really important point to emphasize. Thanks, Joe.  This has been really enlightening.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a really fascinating – and frankly, a bit frustrating – area of biomedical research: antibodies.  Specifically, the problem of unreliable antibodies and how scientists are trying to fix it.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this reproducibility crisis.  Is this what you're talking about?  Like, scientists get results, but then other labs can't replicate them?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  And a huge part of that, um, it seems, is down to these antibodies.  See,  Carl Laflamme, this researcher, he was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease, right?  The gene is called C9ORF72.  He needed antibodies to, you know, find and measure this protein in cells.  But the problem was... well,  there was a real mess. He started looking at existing research papers, and... there was no agreement on where this protein even *was* in the cell.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, what was the problem with the antibodies?  Were they just... bad?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's kind of the short answer, but it's more nuanced than that.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies – these are the ones scientists buy from companies – all supposedly designed to bind to this specific protein.  And only three actually worked properly.  They bound to the target protein *without* binding to other things in the cell.  The other thirteen, they were basically useless for his research.
[INFO] Sarah: So, fifteen out of sixteen? That’s a shockingly low success rate.  And these were commercially available antibodies?  I mean, these are supposed to be reliable tools.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly! And it gets worse.  He found that about fifteen published papers used one of the *bad* antibodies – the one that didn't even bind to the right protein! And those papers had been cited over 3,000 times.  Think about the wasted time, resources, and potentially, the misleading conclusions based on faulty data.  It's a huge problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Three thousand citations...That's...mind-boggling. So, what's being done to fix this?  Besides, you know, just being more careful?
[INFO] Joe: Well, there are several initiatives springing up.  One is called iCharOS –  that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science – and it aims to characterize *every* human protein antibody commercially available.  It's a massive undertaking, but it could really change things.  There's also a push to create better antibodies, make it easier to find reliable ones, and encourage best practices in the field.  It’s a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a huge collaborative effort is needed to solve this.  It's not just one person or one company that can fix this, is it?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a systemic issue.  Um, it's a bit like, you know, building a house with faulty bricks. You can't expect a strong structure if your foundation is weak.  This is the foundation of a lot of biological research, and it's been shaky for far too long.  But there’s hope.  People are realizing the scale of the problem, and they’re actively trying to fix it.  It's a slow process, but hopefully, we're moving in the right direction.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, you've laid out a pretty compelling case for the need for antibody validation, particularly with the YCharOS initiative.  The sheer scale of the problem – millions of antibodies, many of which are, frankly, unreliable – is staggering.  It's not just about individual researchers making mistakes; it's a systemic issue in how these reagents are produced and distributed.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly. And it's not just about the sheer number, it's also about the lack of standardized testing, isn't it?  I mean,  YCharOS is a great example of a collaborative effort to address this, but it highlights how much work there still is to do.  They've tested over a thousand antibodies, and a significant portion didn't perform as advertised. That's... alarming, to say the least.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely alarming.  The problem stems from a few key areas.  First, the manufacturing process itself.  Many antibody suppliers, understandably, prioritize speed and volume over rigorous characterization.  They might perform some basic tests, but the level of scrutiny often isn’t sufficient to guarantee reliability across various applications.  Second, the lack of standardized validation protocols means that different labs might use different methods, making it difficult to compare results.  And third, the issue of context, as Cecilia Williams points out.  An antibody might work perfectly in one cell line, but fail miserably in another.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, and that brings us to the OMAPs initiative, which takes a different approach. They focus on a single application—multiplex imaging—but across multiple contexts, different tissues and imaging methods.  It’s almost the inverse of YCharOS’s approach.  Is one inherently better than the other?  Or are they complementary?
[INFO] Joe: They're complementary, I think.  YCharOS provides a more rigorous, standardized characterization in a specific context.  This gives researchers a baseline level of confidence.  OMAPs, on the other hand, tackles the issue of context-dependent performance.  It relies on community validation, which, while potentially less rigorous in terms of standardized methodology, provides a broader range of real-world application data.  You could argue that OMAPs is more about practical application validation, while YCharOS focuses on fundamental performance characterization.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a two-pronged approach. One focuses on the core functionality of the antibody, the other on its performance within different research settings. That's... elegant, actually.  But it still leaves a huge gap, right?  We're talking about millions of antibodies.  Even with these initiatives, it seems like a drop in the ocean.
[INFO] Joe: You're right. It's a monumental task.  However, these initiatives are setting important precedents.  They're demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale antibody validation, pushing for better standards, and fostering collaboration between researchers, vendors, and funding agencies. It's a slow burn, but progress is being made.  And the awareness is growing, which is crucial.  The more researchers understand the limitations of commercially available antibodies, the more likely they are to demand higher standards and incorporate rigorous validation into their own work.
[INFO] Sarah: It really does highlight the importance of skepticism and careful experimental design, doesn't it?  We can't just blindly trust the catalogue.  We need to be critical consumers of these reagents.  It's a crucial lesson for the entire field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, that whole section about antibodies… it’s a real mess, isn't it?  It sounds like a huge problem for reproducibility in research.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a bigger problem than most people realize.  Um, you know,  the issue is multifaceted.  First, there's the sheer difficulty of finding the right antibodies.  The article mentioned that 90% of antibodies cited in one journal lacked catalogue numbers. That's… astonishing.  It makes repeating experiments incredibly hard.
[INFO] Sarah: Ninety percent!  Wow. So, what’s the solution then? Just better record keeping?
[INFO] Joe: Partly.  The RRIDs, research resource identifiers, are a step in the right direction.  They provide unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other resources, solving the problem of catalogue numbers disappearing or being duplicated.  It's a system for tracking them, essentially.  Think of it like a permanent, universal product code, but for scientific reagents.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so that helps with *finding* the antibodies, but what about knowing if they’re *actually any good*?  The article mentioned CiteAb… is that the solution to that?
[INFO] Joe: CiteAb is a helpful resource, it's a search engine that aggregates information on antibody citations, and increasingly, validation data.  It helps researchers see which antibodies are frequently used, suggesting they might be reliable. But, and this is a big but,  a high citation count doesn't automatically mean an antibody is good.  Many factors influence citation frequency that have nothing to do with accuracy.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, publication bias and all that.  So, even with CiteAb, there’s no guarantee of quality.  What about this "knock-out validation"? The article mentioned it.
[INFO] Joe: Knock-out validation is essentially confirming the antibody's specificity by using a genetically modified organism lacking the target protein. If the antibody doesn't bind in the absence of the target, it's more likely to be specific. It's considered the gold standard, but… less than 5% of antibodies are validated this way.
[INFO] Sarah: So, we’re relying on a system where most antibodies lack proper identification, and even when they're found, there's no guarantee of quality.  It sounds…  depressing.  What are people doing about it?
[INFO] Joe: Well, there's a growing awareness of the problem. The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is a good example. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders—the whole ecosystem—to try and improve things.  It's a collaborative effort to address the problem from multiple angles.  It's a very complex issue, so a multi-pronged approach is needed.
[INFO] Sarah: It's definitely a huge challenge. It really does underscore the need for transparency and rigorous validation in scientific research.  Thanks for clarifying all that, Joe.  It's a lot to take in.
[INFO] Joe: No problem, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, and it's important to discuss it.  Hopefully, initiatives like OGA can help make a real difference in the future.
[INFO] Joe: Right, so where were we? Ah yes, OGA and the push for better antibody reliability.  It's a multifaceted problem, isn't it?  The core issue boils down to reproducibility.  Historically, many antibodies were generated using hybridoma technology – basically, fusing immune cells to create immortalized cell lines that produce antibodies.  The problem is, these hybridomas can be unstable, leading to batch-to-batch variation in antibody production.  Each batch might have slightly different properties, affecting experimental results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, that's why the shift towards recombinant antibodies is so significant?  It sounds like a simpler, more controlled process.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. Recombinant antibodies are produced using genetically engineered cells programmed to produce a specific antibody sequence.  This eliminates the inherent variability of the hybridoma method.  You get a consistent product, batch after batch.  It's a much more standardized process, leading to greater reproducibility in research.  Think of it like this... well, no, let's not use an analogy.  It's simply a difference in the *method* of production, leading to vastly improved consistency.
[INFO] Sarah: Makes sense.  But even with recombinant antibodies, researchers still need to validate them, right?  It's not a magic bullet?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  Even with recombinant technology, validation is crucial.  There's always the possibility of errors in the genetic engineering process, or the antibody might not bind to the target protein as expected.  Independent validation is a critical step to ensure the reliability of any antibody, regardless of its production method.  That’s why initiatives like OGA are so important; they’re pushing for better practices and data sharing to help researchers make informed choices.
[INFO] Sarah: So, the OGA community is working on making it easier to find and use validated antibodies.  And they're also trying to incentivize researchers to use best practices, which is... interesting.  It's not just a technical problem, it's a behavioral one too.  Scientists might be hesitant to change their habits, even if there's evidence that a certain antibody is unreliable.
[INFO] Joe: You're absolutely right.  It's a cultural shift that's needed, as much as a technological one.  There's inertia, and sometimes researchers are reluctant to abandon antibodies they've been using for years, even if there are better alternatives available.  The incentives offered by OGA and others are a crucial part of overcoming that inertia.  It's about creating a system where using validated antibodies becomes the norm, not the exception.  And, you know, sometimes it's just a matter of making good data readily available and easily accessible.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, they sound worse than they are, honestly.  Immunohistochemistry, or IHC, is basically like staining cells. You've got a sample of cells, right? And you use an antibody – that's, you know, a protein that specifically binds to another protein – to see if a particular protein is present in those cells.  If the antibody binds, it shows up as a color change, indicating the protein is there.  It's a pretty visual method.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's like... a highlighter for proteins?  A very specific highlighter, though.
[INFO] Joe: I guess you could say that, yeah.  A very, very specific highlighter. It's more precise than that, but for a basic understanding, that works.  Western blotting is different.  It's used to confirm the antibody binds to the *correct* protein. You separate proteins by size, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size. Think of it like… um…  okay, forget the analogy. It’s a different technique entirely.  You get a band on a gel, and the position of that band tells you the molecular weight. If it's where you expect it, then your antibody is targeting the right protein.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so IHC shows *where* the protein is, and Western blotting shows *what* protein it is?  Is that a fair summary?
[INFO] Joe: Pretty much.  And then immunoprecipitation… that's a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally pull out the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it as fishing with a very specific bait – the antibody.  Then, you can analyze what you've caught using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  It’s a more definitive way of proving that your antibody is really binding to what it's supposed to.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  Getting it wrong at this stage means everything else could be wrong. It cascades down.  It’s a bit like building a house; if the foundation is weak, the whole thing is at risk.  Though, again, I'm trying to avoid analogies...
[INFO] Sarah: Right. So, you're using multiple techniques to be absolutely sure.  It sounds like a pretty rigorous process.  And I guess, as you mentioned earlier, this reliability is crucial for all the downstream applications.
[INFO] Sarah: (laughs)  I understand.  It's just helpful sometimes to picture things.  So, this validation process is really the cornerstone of reliable research.  It’s not just about publishing a paper; it's about ensuring the accuracy of the entire scientific process.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of technology, incentives, and community effort.  It sounds like a huge undertaking.  But the potential payoff – more reliable research – is huge as well.  It makes a real difference to the research process.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's about building trust and confidence in the results.  And that trust is essential for everything from drug development to diagnostics.  Without reliable antibodies, we're essentially working in the dark.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  And it's not just about the research itself; it's about the downstream consequences.  More reliable results translate to better drug development, more effective therapies, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.  It's a long game, but a very important one.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about validating antibodies.  You mentioned immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Um, can you break those down a little more for our listeners?  I mean, I’ve heard the terms, but… they sound a bit intimidating.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a really important point to emphasize. Thanks, Joe.  This has been really enlightening.
[INFO] Joe: Thank you for joining us on this episode of Science Odyssey, where we explored the groundbreaking research shaping our understanding of the world. If you enjoyed this journey, don't forget to subscribe, leave a review, and share the podcast with fellow science enthusiasts.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Hey kids! Welcome to Podify Kids, where we make learning super fun and exciting! Get ready for cool stories, awesome facts, and tons of laughs as we explore the world together! Today, we're diving into the magical world of… VECTORS!

Sarah:  Vectors?  Sounds a bit… pointy!  What *are* vectors, Joe?

Joe:  Haha, you're right, Sarah! They *are* kind of like pointy things… but in a super cool, scientific way! Imagine an arrow. That arrow shows two things: how strong a push or pull is, and which way it's going. That, my friends, is a vector!

Sarah:  Like, if I push my toy car *really* hard… that's a strong vector? And if I push it forward, that's the direction of the vector?

Joe:  Exactly!  You've got it, Sarah!  The harder you push, the longer the arrow – the stronger the vector.  And the direction you push it… that's the arrow's direction.  So a little tiny push is a short arrow, and a super-duper strong push is a long, long arrow!

Sarah:  Wow! So, like, the wind is a vector?

Joe:  Absolutely!  A strong wind is a long, powerful vector blowing maybe towards the west, or maybe towards the mountains!  A gentle breeze is a short, little vector.  It's all about the strength and direction!

Joe:  Okay, imagine this: you're playing soccer. You kick the ball!  That kick is a vector! It has a certain strength – how hard you kicked it – and a direction – where it's flying!

Sarah:  So even a bird flying uses vectors?

Joe:  Yup! Its wings push the air, creating vectors that lift it up and push it forward. It's like the bird is using tiny invisible arrows to fly!  Pretty amazing, huh?

Sarah:  That's mind-blowing!  Okay, quick question for our listeners!  What's a real-world example of a vector?  Think about something you do every day!  Is it pushing a door open?  Throwing a ball?  Riding your bike?  Let us know in the comments!

Joe:  Great question, Sarah!  And you're right, those are all examples of vectors!  Even something as simple as opening a door involves a vector – the force you apply and the direction you push!

Sarah:  So vectors aren't just for scientists and astronauts, huh?

Joe:  Nope!  Engineers use vectors to build bridges and skyscrapers, making sure they're strong enough to stand tall!  Video game designers use vectors to make your character jump and run!  Vectors are everywhere, even if we don't always see them!

Joe:  And that’s it for today’s episode of Podify Kids. Remember kids, vectors are all around us, making the world move!  Don’t forget to subscribe for more fun learning adventures!

Sarah: Bye everyone! And keep exploring!
