Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of scientific research: the reliability of antibodies.  Um, you know, it's a problem that's been plaguing the field for decades.  We're going to talk about Carl Laflamme's work, and his, ah, rather shocking findings.  He was studying this protein, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, implicated in motor neuron disease, ALS.


Sarah:  Right.  And I think a lot of people listening might not even realize how crucial antibodies are to biological research.  Could you explain that a bit more simply?

Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are essentially like tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  Your immune system uses them to identify and neutralize things like viruses and bacteria.  Scientists borrow this system, using antibodies to pinpoint specific proteins within cells or tissues.  Think of it like... well, maybe not an analogy, but like using a special key to unlock a specific door (a protein), and you need the *right* key.  If the key doesn't fit perfectly, you can't get into the door.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies are... well, they're faulty keys.

Sarah: Faulty keys!  That's a great way to put it. So, what was Laflamme's discovery then?  What made his work so significant?

Joe:  Well, Laflamme was trying to figure out where this C9ORF72 protein was located within the cell.  He looked at the existing literature – and this is where it gets messy – and found a huge discrepancy.  Different papers, using different antibodies, reported completely different locations for this protein.  So, he decided to test the antibodies themselves. He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies, all supposedly targeting the same protein.  And, um, the results were, to put it mildly, disappointing.  Only three actually worked as advertised; they specifically bound to the target protein and nothing else. Fifteen didn't!  And these fifteen had been used in studies cited thousands of times.

Sarah:  Thousands of times!  That's... astounding.  And potentially devastating for all the research built on those faulty antibodies.  That really speaks to the reproducibility crisis in science, doesn't it?  The idea that a lot of research can't be replicated because of these fundamental issues.

Joe: Exactly!  It's a huge problem.  It wastes time, money, and resources.  It slows down scientific progress, and potentially, drug development.  That's why Laflamme, along with Aled Edwards, started this initiative called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science – to try and systematically test all commercially available antibodies for human proteins.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.

Sarah:  It certainly sounds like it.  So, is there hope for a solution?  Is there a way to improve antibody quality control?

Joe:  There’s definitely hope.  Several groups are working on this.  There are efforts to develop better antibodies, to improve testing and verification processes, and to make sure researchers are trained on how to properly select and use them.  It's going to take a collective effort from antibody vendors, funding agencies, journals – everyone.  It's a slow process but there is a growing recognition that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.  It's a long road, but I'm hopeful.  It’s too important not to fix.

Sarah:  Absolutely.  It's great to hear some positive developments.  Thanks for explaining all this so clearly, Joe. This is a critical issue for the future of scientific research.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And thanks to everyone listening for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  We'll be back next week with another fascinating scientific journey.

My pleasure, Sarah.  And thanks to everyone listening for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  We'll be back next week with another fascinating scientific journey.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, that was quite a story about antibody validation.  The sheer scale of the problem – millions of antibodies, many not working as advertised – is, uh, staggering, isn't it?

Sarah:  It really is, Joe.  And it highlights a critical issue in research.  We're relying on these antibodies for crucial experiments, but there's a significant chance they might not be doing what they're supposed to.  This YCharOS initiative seems like a huge step forward, but I'm curious about their methodology.  Could you explain how they actually *test* these antibodies?

Joe: Sure.  Their core method is a comparative approach.  They use two cell lines: one that *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is designed to bind to – at normal levels, and a "knockout" cell line that lacks that protein entirely.  They then test the antibody in both cell lines.  If the antibody only binds to the cell line with the target protein, and shows no binding in the knockout, that suggests good specificity.  It's a pretty straightforward way to assess whether the antibody is actually recognizing the intended protein.

Sarah: So, it's a simple yet powerful control, right?  Like, a "does it work as expected" check?

Joe: Exactly.  It's a fundamental control that's surprisingly often missing.  The lack of this kind of rigorous testing explains why so many antibodies failed their tests.  They essentially missed that basic validation step.

Sarah: Right.  But YCharOS tested 614 antibodies and found that two-thirds didn't work as advertised.  That's...a lot.  What does "didn't work" mean in this context?  Does it mean they didn't bind at all, or something less straightforward?

Joe: It means the antibody didn't show the expected specificity.  It might have bound weakly, bound to other proteins besides the target, or shown other inconsistencies compared to the manufacturer's claims.  It's not necessarily a complete failure, but it's enough to cast doubt on its reliability for research purposes.  The manufacturer's claims are simply not supported by the data from YCharOS' testing.

Sarah:  I see.  And this collaborative approach with manufacturers – providing antibodies for free and allowing them to review reports – is key to their success, right?

Joe: Absolutely.  That level of cooperation is unprecedented.  It fosters transparency and allows manufacturers to address any issues identified.  It's a much more effective approach than simply publishing negative results without any opportunity for feedback or improvement.

Sarah:  It sounds like a model for other fields, too.  But you mentioned other initiatives, like OMAPs. How does that differ from YCharOS?

Joe:  OMAPs focuses on a single application – multiplex imaging – but across different contexts like various tissues and imaging methods.  YCharOS, on the other hand, focuses on characterizing antibodies for various applications within a more controlled environment.  They're both valuable, but they address different aspects of antibody validation.  Think of it as YCharOS providing a foundational level of validation, and OMAPs building upon that in specific, more complex applications.

Sarah: That makes sense.  So, a two-pronged approach to tackle this massive problem.  It's a reassuring picture, though the scale of the problem is still quite daunting.  Thanks, Joe, for clarifying all this.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And thanks again to our listeners.  Until next time!

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Podcast intro music fades out)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back, everyone!  We're chatting today with Joe about the surprisingly tricky world of antibodies in research. Joe, thanks for joining us again.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. And thanks again to our listeners.  Um, so, where were we? Ah yes, antibodies.  It's a mess, isn't it?  Even if you *have* good antibodies, finding them is a real challenge.

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  I mean, you'd think in this day and age, with all the technological advancements, tracking down a specific antibody would be straightforward.  But from what I've read, it's... chaotic, to say the least.  Can you break down why that is?

**Joe:**  Right.  So, a big part of the problem is the lack of consistent labeling. Think about it: different companies use their own catalogue numbers.  One company's number 123 might be completely different from another company's number 123.  And, you know, companies go out of business, products get discontinued, and suddenly that catalogue number is useless.  It's like trying to find a specific book in a library without a proper Dewey Decimal system – a complete nightmare.

**Sarah:** So, that's where these RRIDs come in, right?  Research Resource Identifiers?

**Joe:**  Precisely.  They're unique, persistent identifiers designed to solve that exact problem.  They're like a universal product code, but for research reagents.  So, even if a company stops making an antibody, the RRID remains, allowing researchers to find information about that specific antibody, even if the original source is gone.  It’s a crucial step towards better reproducibility.

**Sarah:**  That makes a lot of sense.  But even if you *can* find an antibody with an RRID, how do you know it's actually *good*?  I mean, how do you verify its quality and reliability?

**Joe:**  That's the even bigger hurdle, Sarah.  There's no single, universally accepted standard for antibody validation.  Some researchers rely on citation counts –  how often an antibody is mentioned in publications –  but that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality.  Others look for independent validations, but even then, the methods used can vary wildly.  It’s a bit of a wild west out there.

**Sarah:**  It sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, what are some of the steps being taken to improve this situation?

**Joe:** Well, initiatives like CiteAb are trying to create a centralized database of antibodies, including information on their citations and, when available, validation data.  And then you have communities like Only Good Antibodies (OGA) bringing together researchers, manufacturers, and funders to collaboratively address the issue.  It's a multi-faceted problem requiring a multi-faceted solution.

**Sarah:**  It's fascinating to hear how many different stakeholders are involved, and how collaborative these efforts need to be.  So, is there any light at the end of the tunnel?  Any reason to be optimistic about resolving this antibody identification and validation crisis?

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  The increasing awareness of the problem, combined with these collaborative efforts and the development of tools like RRIDs and CiteAb, offers a lot of hope.  It's a long road, but we're definitely moving in the right direction.  It's slow, but progress is being made.  It's not a quick fix, but the future looks a little brighter.

**(Podcast outro music fades in)**

**Sarah:**  That’s incredibly encouraging, Joe. Thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue.  And thank you to our listeners for tuning in!

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

**Sarah:** Welcome back everyone!  We've been discussing the challenges with antibody reliability in research, and Joe's been incredibly generous with his expertise. Joe, before we wrap up, I wanted to delve a little deeper into recombinant antibodies. You mentioned them earlier, but could you explain, in simple terms, what makes them different from the older methods?

**Joe:** Sure, Sarah. So, the older methods often involved generating antibodies from immunized animals, or even hybridomas – which are like, you know, fused immune cells. The problem is, this process is inherently variable.  Each batch of antibodies produced this way can have slightly different properties.  Think of it like baking a cake – every time, even with the same recipe, you might get a slightly different result.

**Sarah:**  Okay, I think I get that. So, the variation is a major issue?

**Joe:** Exactly.  That variability makes it hard to reproduce experiments.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence.  It's like having a precise, automated cake-making machine.  Every cake is identical.

**Sarah:** So, it's like a template, a blueprint, for the antibody?  That removes the inherent variability.

**Joe:** Precisely. The process is much more controlled and standardized, leading to greater consistency between batches. This is crucial for reproducibility in scientific research.

**Sarah:**  This makes a lot of sense.  But, even with this advantage, you mentioned earlier that there are still challenges in getting scientists to adopt these recombinant antibodies. Why is that?

**Joe:** Hmm, that's a complex issue.  Inertia is a big factor.  Researchers may be comfortable with their existing methods, even if they know they're less reliable.  There's also a learning curve involved in switching to new techniques and understanding the nuances of recombinant antibody production and validation.  Plus,  there's the cost factor to consider. Though, that's becoming less of a barrier as production scales up.

**Sarah:**  So it's a combination of habit, cost, and the effort needed to learn new techniques?  That's quite a hurdle to overcome.  What are some of the incentives being used to encourage this shift?

**Joe:** Well, several organizations are working on this.  Funders are offering grants to researchers who participate in antibody validation projects.  Publishers are also starting to reward the use of best practices, emphasizing the importance of reporting antibody information transparently.  And, manufacturers are playing a key role by producing and readily supplying more recombinant antibodies.

**Sarah:** It sounds like a multi-pronged approach is needed.  It's fascinating to see how different players – researchers, funders, publishers, and manufacturers – are all working together to address this critical issue.  And it all boils down to improving the reliability of scientific research, which is ultimately beneficial to everyone.

**Joe:** Absolutely, Sarah. It's a collaborative effort, and the progress is encouraging.  The younger generation of scientists seems particularly invested in fostering better practices and collaboration.

**Sarah:** That’s incredibly encouraging to hear.  Thank you again, Joe, for your insightful explanations. And thank you to our listeners for joining us!

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 (Sound of a gentle transition, perhaps a slight shift in tone)

Sarah:  So, Joe, we’ve covered a lot of ground today.  Those validation methods… they sound pretty rigorous, but also, um,  a bit complex.  Let's say I'm a listener who's not a scientist.  Can you maybe… simplify the overall idea?

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  The basic idea is that before scientists use an antibody – you know, that thing that targets a specific protein – they need to make absolutely sure it's actually doing what it’s supposed to do. It’s like, you wouldn’t use a wrench to hammer a nail, right?  So, these methods, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation… they're all different ways of double-checking the antibody's accuracy.

Sarah:  Okay, so it's like quality control for the antibody?

Joe: Exactly.  Immunohistochemistry, for example, shows us if the antibody binds to the right cells.  Think of it like… well, maybe this isn't the best analogy, but imagine using a special dye to highlight specific cells under a microscope. If the dye only sticks to the cells we expect, the antibody is likely working correctly. Western blotting is a bit different; it confirms the antibody binds to the *correct protein* by looking at its size.  And immunoprecipitation… that's more like fishing for the specific protein using the antibody as bait, and then checking if we caught the right fish.

Sarah:  So each method offers a different kind of confirmation?  They're not redundant?

Joe:  Right. They provide complementary information. One method alone might not be enough to definitively say the antibody works perfectly.  Using multiple methods gives us much greater confidence in the results.  It’s all about minimizing the chance of error, you know?  Science is about being careful.

Sarah: That makes a lot more sense, thanks.  It sounds like a lot of work to validate just one antibody!

Joe: It is, Sarah.  It's a painstaking process, but absolutely crucial for reliable scientific findings.  And that's why –  uh,  that's why some scientists might feel frustrated sometimes.  It's not always glamorous, but it's essential.

Sarah:  Absolutely.  So,  before we wrap up, is there anything else you think our listeners should know about this validation process?  Any final thoughts?

Joe:  Just that this level of rigor is typical in good scientific research. It’s not unique to antibody validation.  Scientists are constantly striving for accuracy and reproducibility.  It’s a fundamental aspect of the scientific method.

Sarah: That's a great point to end on, Joe. Thank you for joining us on this episode of Science Odyssey, where we explored the groundbreaking research shaping our understanding of the world.

[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of scientific research: the reliability of antibodies.  Um, you know, it's a problem that's been plaguing the field for decades.  We're going to talk about Carl Laflamme's work, and his, ah, rather shocking findings.  He was studying this protein, encoded by the C9ORF72 gene, implicated in motor neuron disease, ALS.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  And I think a lot of people listening might not even realize how crucial antibodies are to biological research.  Could you explain that a bit more simply?
[INFO] Sarah: Faulty keys!  That's a great way to put it. So, what was Laflamme's discovery then?  What made his work so significant?
[INFO] Joe: Well, Laflamme was trying to figure out where this C9ORF72 protein was located within the cell.  He looked at the existing literature – and this is where it gets messy – and found a huge discrepancy.  Different papers, using different antibodies, reported completely different locations for this protein.  So, he decided to test the antibodies themselves. He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies, all supposedly targeting the same protein.  And, um, the results were, to put it mildly, disappointing.  Only three actually worked as advertised; they specifically bound to the target protein and nothing else. Fifteen didn't!  And these fifteen had been used in studies cited thousands of times.
[INFO] Sarah: Thousands of times!  That's... astounding.  And potentially devastating for all the research built on those faulty antibodies.  That really speaks to the reproducibility crisis in science, doesn't it?  The idea that a lot of research can't be replicated because of these fundamental issues.
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are essentially like tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  Your immune system uses them to identify and neutralize things like viruses and bacteria.  Scientists borrow this system, using antibodies to pinpoint specific proteins within cells or tissues.  Think of it like... well, maybe not an analogy, but like using a special key to unlock a specific door (a protein), and you need the *right* key.  If the key doesn't fit perfectly, you can't get into the door.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies are... well, they're faulty keys.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  It's a huge problem.  It wastes time, money, and resources.  It slows down scientific progress, and potentially, drug development.  That's why Laflamme, along with Aled Edwards, started this initiative called iCharOS –  Antibody Characterization through Open Science – to try and systematically test all commercially available antibodies for human proteins.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.
[INFO] Sarah: It certainly sounds like it.  So, is there hope for a solution?  Is there a way to improve antibody quality control?
[INFO] Joe: There’s definitely hope.  Several groups are working on this.  There are efforts to develop better antibodies, to improve testing and verification processes, and to make sure researchers are trained on how to properly select and use them.  It's going to take a collective effort from antibody vendors, funding agencies, journals – everyone.  It's a slow process but there is a growing recognition that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.  It's a long road, but I'm hopeful.  It’s too important not to fix.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely.  It's great to hear some positive developments.  Thanks for explaining all this so clearly, Joe. This is a critical issue for the future of scientific research.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And thanks to everyone listening for tuning in to Science Odyssey.  We'll be back next week with another fascinating scientific journey.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, that was quite a story about antibody validation.  The sheer scale of the problem – millions of antibodies, many not working as advertised – is, uh, staggering, isn't it?
[INFO] Sarah: It really is, Joe.  And it highlights a critical issue in research.  We're relying on these antibodies for crucial experiments, but there's a significant chance they might not be doing what they're supposed to.  This YCharOS initiative seems like a huge step forward, but I'm curious about their methodology.  Could you explain how they actually *test* these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Their core method is a comparative approach.  They use two cell lines: one that *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is designed to bind to – at normal levels, and a "knockout" cell line that lacks that protein entirely.  They then test the antibody in both cell lines.  If the antibody only binds to the cell line with the target protein, and shows no binding in the knockout, that suggests good specificity.  It's a pretty straightforward way to assess whether the antibody is actually recognizing the intended protein.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a simple yet powerful control, right?  Like, a "does it work as expected" check?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a fundamental control that's surprisingly often missing.  The lack of this kind of rigorous testing explains why so many antibodies failed their tests.  They essentially missed that basic validation step.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  But YCharOS tested 614 antibodies and found that two-thirds didn't work as advertised.  That's...a lot.  What does "didn't work" mean in this context?  Does it mean they didn't bind at all, or something less straightforward?
[INFO] Joe: It means the antibody didn't show the expected specificity.  It might have bound weakly, bound to other proteins besides the target, or shown other inconsistencies compared to the manufacturer's claims.  It's not necessarily a complete failure, but it's enough to cast doubt on its reliability for research purposes.  The manufacturer's claims are simply not supported by the data from YCharOS' testing.
[INFO] Sarah: I see.  And this collaborative approach with manufacturers – providing antibodies for free and allowing them to review reports – is key to their success, right?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  That level of cooperation is unprecedented.  It fosters transparency and allows manufacturers to address any issues identified.  It's a much more effective approach than simply publishing negative results without any opportunity for feedback or improvement.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a model for other fields, too.  But you mentioned other initiatives, like OMAPs. How does that differ from YCharOS?
[INFO] Joe: OMAPs focuses on a single application – multiplex imaging – but across different contexts like various tissues and imaging methods.  YCharOS, on the other hand, focuses on characterizing antibodies for various applications within a more controlled environment.  They're both valuable, but they address different aspects of antibody validation.  Think of it as YCharOS providing a foundational level of validation, and OMAPs building upon that in specific, more complex applications.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes sense.  So, a two-pronged approach to tackle this massive problem.  It's a reassuring picture, though the scale of the problem is still quite daunting.  Thanks, Joe, for clarifying all this.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And thanks again to our listeners.  Until next time!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back, everyone!  We're chatting today with Joe about the surprisingly tricky world of antibodies in research. Joe, thanks for joining us again.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah. And thanks again to our listeners.  Um, so, where were we? Ah yes, antibodies.  It's a mess, isn't it?  Even if you *have* good antibodies, finding them is a real challenge.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  I mean, you'd think in this day and age, with all the technological advancements, tracking down a specific antibody would be straightforward.  But from what I've read, it's... chaotic, to say the least.  Can you break down why that is?
[INFO] Joe: **  Right.  So, a big part of the problem is the lack of consistent labeling. Think about it: different companies use their own catalogue numbers.  One company's number 123 might be completely different from another company's number 123.  And, you know, companies go out of business, products get discontinued, and suddenly that catalogue number is useless.  It's like trying to find a specific book in a library without a proper Dewey Decimal system – a complete nightmare.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, that's where these RRIDs come in, right?  Research Resource Identifiers?
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely.  They're unique, persistent identifiers designed to solve that exact problem.  They're like a universal product code, but for research reagents.  So, even if a company stops making an antibody, the RRID remains, allowing researchers to find information about that specific antibody, even if the original source is gone.  It’s a crucial step towards better reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That makes a lot of sense.  But even if you *can* find an antibody with an RRID, how do you know it's actually *good*?  I mean, how do you verify its quality and reliability?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's the even bigger hurdle, Sarah.  There's no single, universally accepted standard for antibody validation.  Some researchers rely on citation counts –  how often an antibody is mentioned in publications –  but that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality.  Others look for independent validations, but even then, the methods used can vary wildly.  It’s a bit of a wild west out there.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, what are some of the steps being taken to improve this situation?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, initiatives like CiteAb are trying to create a centralized database of antibodies, including information on their citations and, when available, validation data.  And then you have communities like Only Good Antibodies (OGA) bringing together researchers, manufacturers, and funders to collaboratively address the issue.  It's a multi-faceted problem requiring a multi-faceted solution.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It's fascinating to hear how many different stakeholders are involved, and how collaborative these efforts need to be.  So, is there any light at the end of the tunnel?  Any reason to be optimistic about resolving this antibody identification and validation crisis?
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  The increasing awareness of the problem, combined with these collaborative efforts and the development of tools like RRIDs and CiteAb, offers a lot of hope.  It's a long road, but we're definitely moving in the right direction.  It's slow, but progress is being made.  It's not a quick fix, but the future looks a little brighter.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That’s incredibly encouraging, Joe. Thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue.  And thank you to our listeners for tuning in!
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back everyone!  We've been discussing the challenges with antibody reliability in research, and Joe's been incredibly generous with his expertise. Joe, before we wrap up, I wanted to delve a little deeper into recombinant antibodies. You mentioned them earlier, but could you explain, in simple terms, what makes them different from the older methods?
[INFO] Joe: ** Sure, Sarah. So, the older methods often involved generating antibodies from immunized animals, or even hybridomas – which are like, you know, fused immune cells. The problem is, this process is inherently variable.  Each batch of antibodies produced this way can have slightly different properties.  Think of it like baking a cake – every time, even with the same recipe, you might get a slightly different result.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, I think I get that. So, the variation is a major issue?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  That variability makes it hard to reproduce experiments.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence.  It's like having a precise, automated cake-making machine.  Every cake is identical.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, it's like a template, a blueprint, for the antibody?  That removes the inherent variability.
[INFO] Joe: ** Precisely. The process is much more controlled and standardized, leading to greater consistency between batches. This is crucial for reproducibility in scientific research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  This makes a lot of sense.  But, even with this advantage, you mentioned earlier that there are still challenges in getting scientists to adopt these recombinant antibodies. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: ** Hmm, that's a complex issue.  Inertia is a big factor.  Researchers may be comfortable with their existing methods, even if they know they're less reliable.  There's also a learning curve involved in switching to new techniques and understanding the nuances of recombinant antibody production and validation.  Plus,  there's the cost factor to consider. Though, that's becoming less of a barrier as production scales up.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So it's a combination of habit, cost, and the effort needed to learn new techniques?  That's quite a hurdle to overcome.  What are some of the incentives being used to encourage this shift?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, several organizations are working on this.  Funders are offering grants to researchers who participate in antibody validation projects.  Publishers are also starting to reward the use of best practices, emphasizing the importance of reporting antibody information transparently.  And, manufacturers are playing a key role by producing and readily supplying more recombinant antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: ** It sounds like a multi-pronged approach is needed.  It's fascinating to see how different players – researchers, funders, publishers, and manufacturers – are all working together to address this critical issue.  And it all boils down to improving the reliability of scientific research, which is ultimately beneficial to everyone.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely, Sarah. It's a collaborative effort, and the progress is encouraging.  The younger generation of scientists seems particularly invested in fostering better practices and collaboration.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That’s incredibly encouraging to hear.  Thank you again, Joe, for your insightful explanations. And thank you to our listeners for joining us!
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we’ve covered a lot of ground today.  Those validation methods… they sound pretty rigorous, but also, um,  a bit complex.  Let's say I'm a listener who's not a scientist.  Can you maybe… simplify the overall idea?
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  The basic idea is that before scientists use an antibody – you know, that thing that targets a specific protein – they need to make absolutely sure it's actually doing what it’s supposed to do. It’s like, you wouldn’t use a wrench to hammer a nail, right?  So, these methods, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation… they're all different ways of double-checking the antibody's accuracy.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like quality control for the antibody?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Immunohistochemistry, for example, shows us if the antibody binds to the right cells.  Think of it like… well, maybe this isn't the best analogy, but imagine using a special dye to highlight specific cells under a microscope. If the dye only sticks to the cells we expect, the antibody is likely working correctly. Western blotting is a bit different; it confirms the antibody binds to the *correct protein* by looking at its size.  And immunoprecipitation… that's more like fishing for the specific protein using the antibody as bait, and then checking if we caught the right fish.
[INFO] Sarah: So each method offers a different kind of confirmation?  They're not redundant?
[INFO] Joe: Right. They provide complementary information. One method alone might not be enough to definitively say the antibody works perfectly.  Using multiple methods gives us much greater confidence in the results.  It’s all about minimizing the chance of error, you know?  Science is about being careful.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes a lot more sense, thanks.  It sounds like a lot of work to validate just one antibody!
[INFO] Joe: It is, Sarah.  It's a painstaking process, but absolutely crucial for reliable scientific findings.  And that's why –  uh,  that's why some scientists might feel frustrated sometimes.  It's not always glamorous, but it's essential.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely.  So,  before we wrap up, is there anything else you think our listeners should know about this validation process?  Any final thoughts?
[INFO] Joe: Just that this level of rigor is typical in good scientific research. It’s not unique to antibody validation.  Scientists are constantly striving for accuracy and reproducibility.  It’s a fundamental aspect of the scientific method.
