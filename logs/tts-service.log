Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating story about antibodies – or rather, the *problems* with antibodies – in scientific research.  It's a bigger deal than you might think.

Sarah:  Oh, I'm definitely intrigued.  Antibodies – I mean, aren't they, like, the workhorses of so much biological research?  What's the problem?

Joe:  Exactly!  They are fundamental.  Scientists use them to, um, identify and measure specific proteins.  Think of them as really precise molecular tags. You need a really good tag to correctly identify the molecule you're interested in. But, the problem is, for decades, many commercially available antibodies haven't been performing as advertised.  They're not specific enough.  They might bind to the *intended* protein, but they also bind to other proteins, giving you inaccurate results.

Sarah:  So, you're saying they're giving false positives?  Or, um, maybe even false negatives?  That sounds incredibly frustrating.  How widespread is this issue?

Joe:  Incredibly widespread.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He was trying to find where in the cell this protein was located.  He looked at sixteen different commercially available antibodies, supposedly designed to detect this specific protein.  Only *three* actually worked as expected.  And, get this,  about fifteen papers used an antibody that didn't even bind to the right protein!  These papers had been cited thousands of times.

Sarah:  Wow. Thousands of times... based on faulty data? That's... that’s a huge problem.  So, what's the underlying reason for this? Is it just poor quality control by the companies that make them?

Joe:  It's a complex issue. Part of it is definitely quality control.  But also, historically, the methods used to create and test these antibodies weren't always rigorous.  You know, there wasn't a standardized way of assessing their performance, and there was, ah, less emphasis on validation.  It's a bit like buying a tool that's supposed to be super precise, but it's actually quite blunt.  You’re going to get unreliable results.

Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there a movement to improve things?

Joe:  Absolutely!  There's a growing push for better antibody characterization. Initiatives like iCharOS, that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science, aim to comprehensively test commercially available antibodies. They're trying to create a database of reliable antibodies for every human protein.  There's also a greater emphasis on rigorous testing and better manufacturing practices.

Sarah:  That sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's kind of amazing that this problem has gone on for so long, and now there's finally this concerted effort to fix it.  It gives me hope that science is self-correcting, you know?  Though it makes you wonder how much other research might be affected...

Joe:  Exactly.  It's a huge undertaking, and it highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.  It’s a reminder that even the most fundamental tools in research need constant scrutiny and improvement. And that the reproducibility crisis isn’t just a buzzword; it's a real and significant issue.  But, there's a lot of optimism that things are starting to change.

**Previous Context**:
Exactly.  It's a huge undertaking, and it highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.  It’s a reminder that even the most fundamental tools in research need constant scrutiny and improvement. And that the reproducibility crisis isn’t just a buzzword; it's a real and significant issue.  But, there's a lot of optimism that things are starting to change.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a really fascinating example of how we're starting to address the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically concerning antibodies.  Um, you know, the sheer number of commercially available antibodies – millions – is staggering.  And the fact that a significant portion don't perform as advertised is a huge problem.

Sarah: Exactly.  It’s mind-boggling.  Seven point seven million products...  And it's not just a matter of inconvenience, right?  Incorrect antibody performance can lead to flawed research findings, wasted resources, and even potentially dangerous misinterpretations.  What's particularly impressive about YCharOS is their collaborative approach.  They've managed to get antibody manufacturers on board, which is a huge step forward.

Joe:  Right.  Their methodology is key.  They compare antibody specificity in a cell line expressing the target protein versus a knockout cell line lacking the protein. This direct comparison provides a very clear measure of specificity.  It's a simple, yet powerful, approach.  No fancy analogies needed, really.  The results speak for themselves – two-thirds of the antibodies tested didn't meet expectations.

Sarah:  That's... startling. Two-thirds!  So,  it's not just a few rogue antibodies; it's a systemic issue.  And I think it highlights the importance of negative controls, as mentioned in the article.  It's easy to get caught up in positive results, but having that crucial negative control is essential for validating any findings.

Joe: Absolutely.  The negative control allows you to definitively rule out false positives, ensuring that the antibody is truly binding to the intended target and not something else.  It’s fundamental to sound experimental design.  And YCharOS's impact is already evident.  Manufacturers have reassessed and updated information for many of the flagged antibodies.  Some were even removed from the market, which is a positive sign of accountability.

Sarah:  It is.  But as the article also points out,  it’s not a complete solution.  The context matters, right? The way an antibody performs in one cell line or tissue might differ significantly in another.  This is where initiatives like OMAPs come into play, focusing on validation across multiple contexts.

Joe: Yeah, OMAPs takes a different approach.  Instead of focusing on characterizing antibodies for various applications in a single context,  they focus on a single application – multiplex imaging – but across various contexts, like different tissues and imaging methods.  It's a complementary approach, addressing a different aspect of the problem.  It's not an either/or situation; both are necessary.

Sarah:  So, it sounds like a multi-pronged attack is needed to tackle this widespread issue.  It's not just one solution, but a combination of rigorous testing, collaboration, and a shift in mindset towards more transparent and reproducible research practices.  It's encouraging to see so much progress being made, though.  It gives me hope that we can improve the reliability of research findings.

Joe:  Exactly.  It's a long road, but initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs are crucial steps in the right direction.  The level of collaboration and openness is truly inspiring, and it’s showing results.  It demonstrates that systemic change is possible, even in a field as complex as antibody research.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, slightly frustrating area of research: the reliability of antibodies in scientific studies.  It's a bigger problem than you might think.

Sarah:  Oh, I can imagine.  Antibodies are, like, the workhorses of so many biological experiments, right? You use them to identify and quantify specific proteins.  So, if they're unreliable… that's a huge deal.  What exactly is the problem?

Joe:  Exactly!  The problem is that, um, for a long time, a lot of commercially available antibodies just… didn't work as advertised.  Many didn't bind specifically to the target protein, you know?  They'd bind to other things too, giving you completely false results.  Take the example of Carl Laflamme's research on the C9ORF72 protein. He was studying its role in motor neuron disease,  a really devastating condition.  He started his research and,  uh, he found that the literature was a mess.  Different studies used different antibodies, and they often got wildly different results.

Sarah: So, different antibodies, different results…  sounds like a recipe for irreproducible research. That's a huge problem in science, right?  We want results to be consistent and verifiable.

Joe: Absolutely.  Laflamme, he actually tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly – meaning they bound specifically to the target protein and not to others.  And, get this, none of the published studies using the well-performing antibodies had been previously published.  Incredibly, one antibody that didn't even bind to the right protein was used in around fifteen papers, cited over 3,000 times!  That's a huge amount of potentially flawed research.

Sarah: Wow. Three thousand citations based on a faulty antibody? That's... astounding, and terrifying, honestly. So, what's being done to fix this? Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies that produce these antibodies?

Joe:  It's a multifaceted problem,  and  it's not just about the companies, although they definitely have a role to play.  There are several initiatives springing up. One is  Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or YCharOS – pronounced Icarus. This initiative aims to systematically characterize every commercially available human protein antibody.   It's a huge undertaking, but it's a step towards establishing a reliable database of validated antibodies.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production techniques, making them more specific and reliable.  Plus, there's a push within the scientific community to adopt better practices when choosing and using antibodies.  It's a whole ecosystem of problems needing solutions.

Sarah:  It sounds like a really complex issue with no easy fixes. But this initiative, YCharOS, sounds promising.  It’s a collaborative effort, right?  Scientists working together to solve a problem that has plagued research for decades. That’s encouraging.

Joe:  Yeah, it really is. It shows that the scientific community is recognizing the problem and actively working towards solutions.  It's a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like YCharOS will help to significantly improve the reliability of research in the future.  And that, in turn, will accelerate scientific discovery and hopefully lead to better treatments and cures for diseases like motor neuron disease.

**Previous Context**:
Yeah, it really is. It shows that the scientific community is recognizing the problem and actively working towards solutions.  It's a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like YCharOS will help to significantly improve the reliability of research in the future.  And that, in turn, will accelerate scientific discovery and hopefully lead to better treatments and cures for diseases like motor neuron disease.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe:  So, Sarah, that article really highlights the critical issue with antibody reliability, right?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a significant portion aren't performing as advertised.  The YCharOS initiative is fascinating because of its scale and the level of industry cooperation.  They're not just identifying problems; they're working directly with manufacturers to improve things.

Sarah: Exactly! It's a huge undertaking.  But I'm curious about their methodology.  You mentioned they compare antibody specificity in a cell line expressing the target protein versus a knockout line.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  I mean, for someone who isn't a cell biologist.

Joe:  Sure.  Think of it this way: they have two groups of cells.  One group has the protein the antibody *should* bind to – the "target" protein.  The other group, the knockout, is genetically modified to *lack* that protein.  If the antibody only binds to the cells with the target protein, that's a good sign of specificity.  It means it's binding to the right thing and not just sticking to anything. If it binds to both, that indicates a problem – it's not specific enough.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, essentially, they're using a control group to validate the antibody's performance.  But, um... how does this address the issue that antibodies might perform differently in various contexts, like different tissues or experimental protocols?  The article mentioned that's a limitation.

Joe:  That's a really good point.  YCharOS focuses on a specific, standardized test.  While it's rigorous, it doesn't cover every possible application.  The context – the type of cells, the experimental conditions – can all affect how an antibody behaves.  Think of it like... well, maybe this isn't the best analogy, but it's like a tool. A hammer works well for hammering nails, but not so much for screwing in screws.  An antibody might be great in one cell type, but not another.

Sarah:  Right, so it's a standardized test, but it doesn't guarantee performance in every situation.  Which brings us to OMAPs. They're tackling the contextual issue, but from a different angle.  They're testing in various contexts, but with a focus on a specific application – multiplex imaging, right?

Joe:  Precisely.  YCharOS prioritizes comprehensive characterization within a controlled setting. OMAPs, on the other hand, prioritizes validation across diverse contexts for a specific application.  It's a complementary approach.  One focuses on broad applicability within a defined context, the other on specific applicability across various contexts. It's a two-pronged attack on the problem.

Sarah: So, it seems like we need both these initiatives, and maybe even more, to really get a handle on this widespread antibody problem.  It's not just one solution, but a multifaceted approach.  It's a lot of work, but it's reassuring to see the scientific community tackling this head-on, you know?

Joe: Absolutely. It's a monumental task, but the potential benefits for research are enormous.  Improved antibody reliability means more reliable results, faster progress, and, ultimately, better treatments and cures.

Absolutely. It's a monumental task, but the potential benefits for research are enormous.  Improved antibody reliability means more reliable results, faster progress, and, ultimately, better treatments and cures.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So Joe, this whole antibody reliability issue… it sounds like a massive problem.  This article mentions RRIDs and CiteAb – can you explain those in plain English?  I'm still a little fuzzy on the specifics.

Joe: Sure, Sarah.  Think of RRIDs, Research Resource Identifiers, as unique serial numbers for antibodies.  Um, you know, like a product code, but much more robust and persistent.  The problem is that companies can change their codes, or discontinue products, leaving researchers unable to find the exact antibody used in a previous study.  RRIDs solve that by providing a permanent identifier, regardless of what the manufacturer does.  It's a crucial step towards reproducibility.

Sarah: So, it's like a universal product code, but specifically for research materials.  Makes sense. And CiteAb?

Joe: CiteAb is essentially a search engine, but specifically for antibodies.  It helps researchers find antibodies, and it tries to provide information on how well they've been validated—how well they actually work as intended.  It's a useful tool, but even CiteAb acknowledges that validating antibodies is a huge challenge.  There's no single, universally accepted validation method.

Sarah: Right, because even if an antibody works well in one context, it might not in another.  So it's not just about finding the right antibody, it's about knowing *if* it's the right antibody *for your specific experiment*.

Joe: Exactly.  And that's where things get really tricky.  The article mentions "knock-out validation," which is one way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  But, as the article points out, less than 5% of antibodies have been validated this way.  It's a significant bottleneck.

Sarah:  Wow, less than 5%.  That’s… alarming.  This whole thing highlights a serious reproducibility crisis, doesn’t it?  I mean, if the fundamental tools of research are unreliable, how can we trust the results?

Joe: Absolutely.  It's a huge problem.  The article also mentions this "Only Good Antibodies" community.  That seems like a really proactive step – bringing together researchers, manufacturers, and funders to address the issue collaboratively.  It's not just a technical problem; it's a systemic one requiring a multi-faceted solution.

Sarah:  That's encouraging to hear, at least.  A collaborative effort might be the best way to tackle something this complex.  It really makes you appreciate the challenges involved in scientific research, even at a fundamental level like antibody selection. It's not just about the science itself, but also the infrastructure and reliability of the tools used.

Joe: Yeah, it's a good point.  And it underlines the importance of transparency and data sharing –  making sure that the information researchers need to reproduce experiments is readily available.  RRIDs are a step in that direction, but a lot more work is clearly needed.  It's not a quick fix, that's for sure.

**Previous Context**:
Yeah, it's a good point.  And it underlines the importance of transparency and data sharing –  making sure that the information researchers need to reproduce experiments is readily available.  RRIDs are a step in that direction, but a lot more work is clearly needed.  It's not a quick fix, that's for sure.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, that was a lot of information on antibody reproducibility!  It really highlights the multifaceted nature of the problem, doesn't it?  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is, I think, a key development.  The fact that they're produced in genetically engineered cells means you get much higher batch-to-batch consistency.  That's crucial for reproducibility because you're not relying on the variability inherent in using, you know, immune cells.

Sarah: Right.  But even with recombinant antibodies, it's not a magic bullet, is it?  I mean, the article mentioned researchers still needing to validate their antibodies.  Can you explain why that's still necessary, even with this improved production method?

Joe:  Well, even with a standardized production process, there's always the possibility of, um, unforeseen issues.  Slight variations in the cell culture conditions, for example, could affect the antibody's final properties.  Validation steps, such as Western blotting or immunofluorescence, are essential to confirm that the antibody is actually binding to the intended target and behaving as expected in the experimental system. It's a quality control measure, essentially.  Think of it like this... well, maybe that's not the best analogy... let's just say it's a necessary step to ensure the reliability of your results.

Sarah: So it's not just about the production method, but also ensuring the antibody's performance in the specific experiment?  That makes sense.  The article also mentioned this "wolf-pack mentality" among younger scientists.  What do you make of that? Is it really a new trend?

Joe:  I think it speaks to a greater awareness of the reproducibility crisis and a willingness to collaborate more openly.  Sharing data, validating each other's work... it's a shift towards a more transparent and collaborative research culture.  Whether it's a completely new trend, I'm not sure, but it certainly seems to be gaining momentum. There's a recognition that solving this problem requires a collective effort, not just individual researchers working in silos.

Sarah:  It sounds like a positive shift. But it also seems like there's still a significant challenge in changing the behavior of established scientists who might be resistant to adopting new methods or validating their antibodies.  How do you see that being overcome?

Joe: That's a huge hurdle, yeah.  Incentivizing best practices through funding mechanisms and publication criteria is a good start.  But ultimately, it comes down to education and community pressure.  The more the community emphasizes the importance of reproducibility, the more likely it is that researchers will prioritize these practices. It's a cultural shift that takes time.

Sarah: So, it's not just a technical problem, but also a social and cultural one.  It's a fascinating interplay of scientific rigor and community norms.  Thanks for breaking that down for us, Joe.  It's a complex issue, but it sounds like progress is being made, albeit slowly.

Joe: Absolutely.  It's a slow burn, but definitely progress.  And the increased attention on the issue is, at least, a very positive sign.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.
