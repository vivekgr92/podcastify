Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, pretty frustrating, problem in biomedical research: unreliable antibodies.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that what this is all about?

Joe:  Exactly.  A big part of it, anyway.  Um, you see, scientists use antibodies all the time to, you know, identify and measure specific proteins in cells.  Think of them as really specific molecular tags.  But, and this is a big but,  many commercially available antibodies just don't work as advertised. They might not bind to the *right* protein, or they might bind to lots of other things too, giving you completely misleading results.

Sarah: So, they're basically faulty tools?  Like, imagine a carpenter using a wonky measuring tape – everything they build would be off.

Joe:  Yeah, precisely! And it's not just a little bit off; it can completely derail years of research.  Take the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease,  encoded by a gene called C9ORF72. He started looking for information on this protein, and he found, um, a complete mess.  Loads of papers, using different antibodies, and seemingly contradicting each other about where this protein even *is* in the cell.

Sarah: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, he decided to test the antibodies himself?

Joe:  Exactly. He and his colleagues tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly – meaning they specifically bound to the target protein and nothing else.  And get this:  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited over 3,000 times!

Sarah:  Three thousand times?! That’s… mind-boggling.  So, what's the solution?  Just, you know, better quality control from the companies that make these antibodies?

Joe:  It's more complicated than that, unfortunately.  It's a multi-pronged problem. Yes, better quality control from vendors is crucial. But there are also initiatives springing up, like Laflamme's collaboration with Aled Edwards on a project called iCharOS – that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science –  to systematically test every commercially available antibody against every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it could revolutionize the field.

Sarah:  That sounds like a Herculean task!  But it’s also, you know, incredibly important for the future of research.  This whole thing really highlights how crucial it is to have rigorous, transparent methods in science.  Otherwise, you're building a house on a foundation of sand.

Joe: Exactly. It's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about the whole process – from how they're made and tested to how researchers select and use them.  And, ah, the whole scientific community needs to take responsibility.  This isn't just a problem for antibody manufacturers; it’s a problem for all of us.

**Previous Context**:
Exactly. It's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about the whole process – from how they're made and tested to how researchers select and use them.  And, ah, the whole scientific community needs to take responsibility.  This isn't just a problem for antibody manufacturers; it’s a problem for all of us.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a fascinating example of how collaboration can address a significant problem in antibody research.  The sheer number of antibodies on the market – millions – and the inconsistencies in their performance highlight a critical issue.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves, but the entire validation process.  Um, you know,  the lack of rigorous standardization has created a real bottleneck in research.

Sarah:  Right.  Millions of antibodies, and a significant portion don't perform as advertised.  That's a huge problem, especially considering how much research relies on these tools. What exactly is the YCharOS approach, and why is it so effective?  Is it simply better testing methods, or is there something more to it?

Joe:  Well, their approach is quite methodical. They focus on comparing antibody performance in cell lines that *do* express the target protein against those that *don't*.  This knockout cell line comparison is key to determining specificity.  They're not just looking at whether the antibody *binds*, but whether it binds *specifically* to the intended target.  It's a direct, straightforward approach, avoiding unnecessary complexity.  The key to their success, though, is the cooperation.  Getting manufacturers on board to provide antibodies for testing, and to act on the results, is huge.


Sarah: That's a really important point.  The collaboration aspect seems crucial.  It's not just about independent testing; it's about creating a feedback loop where manufacturers can improve their products based on the data.  But, isn't this a massive undertaking?  How do they manage to test so many antibodies?

Joe: It's definitely a large-scale effort.  But their streamlined methodology, focusing on that core specificity test, allows them to be efficient.  They're not trying to cover every conceivable application of each antibody, which would be impossible. They're focused on this fundamental aspect, which is often overlooked.  And, um...  the fact that manufacturers are contributing significantly reduces the burden.

Sarah:  So, it's a targeted approach, focusing on the most fundamental aspect of antibody function – specificity.  That makes sense.  But the article also mentions OMAPs, which takes a different approach.  How does that compare to YCharOS?

Joe:  OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies for a *specific application*, multiplex imaging, but across various contexts – different tissues, different imaging methods.  YCharOS, on the other hand, focuses on validating the fundamental properties of the antibodies across different applications.  It's kind of like...  YCharOS is checking the engine of the car, making sure the core components are working, while OMAPs is checking how well the car drives on different terrains.  Both are important, but they address different aspects of antibody reliability.

Sarah: That's a helpful analogy, actually.  So, one is about inherent quality, the other about performance in a specific context.  It seems like a combination of both approaches would be ideal.  But, even with these initiatives, there’s still a huge number of antibodies out there that haven't been rigorously validated...  It's a daunting task.

Joe: Absolutely. It's a massive challenge.  But initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs represent significant steps towards improving the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.  It's a continuous process, and ongoing collaboration is key.

Absolutely. It's a massive challenge.  But initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs represent significant steps towards improving the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.  It's a continuous process, and ongoing collaboration is key.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers – as a step towards improvement.  Can you explain how they actually help?  It sounds a bit like a database… but how does it impact reproducibility in practice?

Joe:  Yeah, it's essentially a system for uniquely identifying antibodies.  Think of it like this:  each antibody gets a permanent, unique ID number, a bit like a social security number, but for antibodies.  So, even if a company stops making a particular antibody, or changes its catalog number, the RRID remains the same.  This makes it much easier for researchers to find and use the *exact* same antibody that was used in a previous study, which is crucial for reproducibility.  You know, before RRIDs, finding the same antibody could be like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Now, you have a specific identifier to track it down.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense.  So it's about traceability, essentially. But what about the issue of antibody quality itself?  RRIDs help you find the antibody, but they don't guarantee it's a *good* antibody, right?

Joe: Exactly. That's a completely separate issue.  RRIDs address the problem of finding the specific reagent used in a study; they don't assess its quality.  That's where initiatives like YCharOS and CiteAb come in.  YCharOS characterizes antibodies, providing data on their specificity and other important qualities.  CiteAb, as a search engine, aggregates information from various sources, including YCharOS, to help researchers choose antibodies based on citation frequency and available validation data.  It's a two-pronged approach – find the antibody (RRIDs), then assess its quality (YCharOS, CiteAb, and others).

Sarah:  So, it's almost like a quality control system, but a decentralized one?  And it sounds like there's still a lot of work to be done, even with these initiatives in place.  Less than 5% of antibodies are validated through knockout methods, you mentioned.  That's... concerning.

Joe:  It is.  And that's why initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community are so vital. They're bringing together all stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to collectively address the problem. It's a complex issue with no single, easy solution. It requires a collaborative effort across the entire scientific community.  Um... it's a long-term project, really.  You know, changing research culture takes time.


Sarah:  Absolutely. It's a systemic problem, and it requires a systemic solution.  It's fascinating how much effort is going into fixing this, though.  It highlights the importance of reproducibility in science, and the lengths researchers are going to to improve it.  It gives me hope, actually.  Thanks, Joe. This has been really helpful.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Wow, that's a lot of information! So, to summarize, the main issue is the unreliability of antibodies in research, right?  And the solution seems to be a multi-pronged approach –  better manufacturing, improved data sharing, and even changing researcher behavior.  But Joe, can you break down the "recombinant antibodies" part for me?  What makes them so much better?

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  So, the problem with the older methods of antibody production – using immune cells or hybrids – is that the process is inherently variable. You get batches of antibodies that aren't exactly the same, and that's a huge issue for reproducibility.  Recombinant antibodies are different. They're made using genetically engineered cells that are *programmed* to produce a specific antibody.  Think of it like having a precise recipe, instead of relying on a less consistent natural process.  This means you get a consistent product, batch after batch.  The sequence is known, the structure is known, and therefore the function should be more predictable.

Sarah:  Okay, so it's like... mass-producing a perfectly cloned antibody, rather than relying on a more organic, less predictable method?

Joe:  You could say that, although "cloned" might not be the most precise term. It's more about precisely controlling the production process at a genetic level, ensuring consistency.  The older methods are more like farming – you get a harvest, but the quality and quantity can vary.  Recombinant production is more like a factory assembly line –  much more controlled and standardized.

Sarah: Right, that makes sense. So, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them?  It sounds like there's still some resistance.

Joe:  That's the frustrating part.  Part of it is inertia; researchers may be comfortable with what they're already using.  There's also the cost factor; recombinant antibodies can sometimes be more expensive upfront. But there's also the issue of changing established practices.  Scientists, like anyone else, can be resistant to change, even if that change would significantly improve the quality of their work.  It's a cultural shift that's needed, as much as a technological one.   And then, of course, there's the issue of validating these new antibodies, which takes additional time and resources.

Sarah:  So, it's not just a scientific problem, it's also a sociological one.  That's interesting.  So, the initiatives mentioned, like the OGA community and the work of organizations like NC3Rs, are trying to address both the scientific and the social aspects of this problem?

Joe: Exactly. They're tackling the problem from multiple angles – improving the technology, incentivizing better practices, and fostering a community focused on improvement and sharing best practices.  It's a systemic issue, and it requires a multi-faceted solution.  It's really encouraging to see so much effort being put into this.

Sarah:  It really is.  Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful.  I feel much clearer on the challenges and the solutions being implemented.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah: It really is. Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful. I feel much clearer on the challenges and the solutions being implemented.  So, you mentioned several ways researchers validate antibodies.  Can you walk me through them again, but maybe a little slower this time?  I want to make sure I’ve got it.

Joe:  Sure thing, Sarah.  So, there are a few key methods.  Um… the first is immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  Essentially, you're using the antibody to see if it binds to the specific protein in a sample of cells.  If the antibody *does* bind, it'll essentially "label" those cells, making them visible under a microscope.  So you're directly visualizing the protein's location within the cells.

Sarah: Okay, so it's like… highlighting the protein?  Is that a fair way to think about it?

Joe:  You could say that, yeah.  It’s a visual confirmation.  It shows you *where* the protein is.  Then, there's Western blotting. This one's a bit different.  Here, you separate proteins by size using gel electrophoresis, and then you use the antibody to see if it binds to a specific protein with a known molecular weight.  Think of it like… you're looking for a specific sized package in a pile of packages.  The antibody is your way of finding that one specific package.

Sarah:  So, in Western blotting, you're not looking at the protein *in* the cells, but rather a purified sample of proteins, right?  And you're confirming the *size* of the protein as well as its presence?

Joe: Exactly. You're confirming both its presence and its size.  It’s a different kind of verification.  And then, finally, there’s immunoprecipitation. This is where things get a little more complex.  You use the antibody to essentially fish out the specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it as using a magnet to pull out a specific type of metal from a pile of different metals.  Once you've isolated the protein, you can then use mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  That gives you a very precise identification.

Sarah:  So, each method offers a different level of confirmation, right? IHC is visual, Western blotting checks size and presence, and immunoprecipitation isolates and identifies. That’s a pretty robust validation process, then.

Joe:  Precisely.  Using multiple methods gives you a much more reliable result.  One method alone might leave room for doubt, but using all three provides a much stronger confirmation that your antibody is indeed targeting the correct protein.  It’s about building confidence in your results.

Sarah: That makes a lot more sense now. Thanks for explaining it so clearly.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous validation in scientific research.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It's crucial.  You know, science isn't always straightforward; there are layers of verification.  We need to be confident in our tools.

Sarah: Absolutely.  This has been incredibly helpful.

[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, pretty frustrating, problem in biomedical research: unreliable antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that what this is all about?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  A big part of it, anyway.  Um, you see, scientists use antibodies all the time to, you know, identify and measure specific proteins in cells.  Think of them as really specific molecular tags.  But, and this is a big but,  many commercially available antibodies just don't work as advertised. They might not bind to the *right* protein, or they might bind to lots of other things too, giving you completely misleading results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, they're basically faulty tools?  Like, imagine a carpenter using a wonky measuring tape – everything they build would be off.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, precisely! And it's not just a little bit off; it can completely derail years of research.  Take the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease,  encoded by a gene called C9ORF72. He started looking for information on this protein, and he found, um, a complete mess.  Loads of papers, using different antibodies, and seemingly contradicting each other about where this protein even *is* in the cell.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, he decided to test the antibodies himself?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. He and his colleagues tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly – meaning they specifically bound to the target protein and nothing else.  And get this:  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited over 3,000 times!
[INFO] Sarah: Three thousand times?! That’s… mind-boggling.  So, what's the solution?  Just, you know, better quality control from the companies that make these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: It's more complicated than that, unfortunately.  It's a multi-pronged problem. Yes, better quality control from vendors is crucial. But there are also initiatives springing up, like Laflamme's collaboration with Aled Edwards on a project called iCharOS – that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science –  to systematically test every commercially available antibody against every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it could revolutionize the field.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a Herculean task!  But it’s also, you know, incredibly important for the future of research.  This whole thing really highlights how crucial it is to have rigorous, transparent methods in science.  Otherwise, you're building a house on a foundation of sand.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. It's not just about the antibodies themselves; it's about the whole process – from how they're made and tested to how researchers select and use them.  And, ah, the whole scientific community needs to take responsibility.  This isn't just a problem for antibody manufacturers; it’s a problem for all of us.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, the YCharOS initiative is a fascinating example of how collaboration can address a significant problem in antibody research.  The sheer number of antibodies on the market – millions – and the inconsistencies in their performance highlight a critical issue.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves, but the entire validation process.  Um, you know,  the lack of rigorous standardization has created a real bottleneck in research.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  Millions of antibodies, and a significant portion don't perform as advertised.  That's a huge problem, especially considering how much research relies on these tools. What exactly is the YCharOS approach, and why is it so effective?  Is it simply better testing methods, or is there something more to it?
[INFO] Joe: Well, their approach is quite methodical. They focus on comparing antibody performance in cell lines that *do* express the target protein against those that *don't*.  This knockout cell line comparison is key to determining specificity.  They're not just looking at whether the antibody *binds*, but whether it binds *specifically* to the intended target.  It's a direct, straightforward approach, avoiding unnecessary complexity.  The key to their success, though, is the cooperation.  Getting manufacturers on board to provide antibodies for testing, and to act on the results, is huge.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a really important point.  The collaboration aspect seems crucial.  It's not just about independent testing; it's about creating a feedback loop where manufacturers can improve their products based on the data.  But, isn't this a massive undertaking?  How do they manage to test so many antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: It's definitely a large-scale effort.  But their streamlined methodology, focusing on that core specificity test, allows them to be efficient.  They're not trying to cover every conceivable application of each antibody, which would be impossible. They're focused on this fundamental aspect, which is often overlooked.  And, um...  the fact that manufacturers are contributing significantly reduces the burden.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a targeted approach, focusing on the most fundamental aspect of antibody function – specificity.  That makes sense.  But the article also mentions OMAPs, which takes a different approach.  How does that compare to YCharOS?
[INFO] Joe: OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies for a *specific application*, multiplex imaging, but across various contexts – different tissues, different imaging methods.  YCharOS, on the other hand, focuses on validating the fundamental properties of the antibodies across different applications.  It's kind of like...  YCharOS is checking the engine of the car, making sure the core components are working, while OMAPs is checking how well the car drives on different terrains.  Both are important, but they address different aspects of antibody reliability.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a helpful analogy, actually.  So, one is about inherent quality, the other about performance in a specific context.  It seems like a combination of both approaches would be ideal.  But, even with these initiatives, there’s still a huge number of antibodies out there that haven't been rigorously validated...  It's a daunting task.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. It's a massive challenge.  But initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs represent significant steps towards improving the reliability and reproducibility of antibody-based research.  It's a continuous process, and ongoing collaboration is key.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers – as a step towards improvement.  Can you explain how they actually help?  It sounds a bit like a database… but how does it impact reproducibility in practice?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's essentially a system for uniquely identifying antibodies.  Think of it like this:  each antibody gets a permanent, unique ID number, a bit like a social security number, but for antibodies.  So, even if a company stops making a particular antibody, or changes its catalog number, the RRID remains the same.  This makes it much easier for researchers to find and use the *exact* same antibody that was used in a previous study, which is crucial for reproducibility.  You know, before RRIDs, finding the same antibody could be like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Now, you have a specific identifier to track it down.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. That's a completely separate issue.  RRIDs address the problem of finding the specific reagent used in a study; they don't assess its quality.  That's where initiatives like YCharOS and CiteAb come in.  YCharOS characterizes antibodies, providing data on their specificity and other important qualities.  CiteAb, as a search engine, aggregates information from various sources, including YCharOS, to help researchers choose antibodies based on citation frequency and available validation data.  It's a two-pronged approach – find the antibody (RRIDs), then assess its quality (YCharOS, CiteAb, and others).
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense.  So it's about traceability, essentially. But what about the issue of antibody quality itself?  RRIDs help you find the antibody, but they don't guarantee it's a *good* antibody, right?
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's almost like a quality control system, but a decentralized one?  And it sounds like there's still a lot of work to be done, even with these initiatives in place.  Less than 5% of antibodies are validated through knockout methods, you mentioned.  That's... concerning.
[INFO] Joe: It is.  And that's why initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community are so vital. They're bringing together all stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funders, publishers – to collectively address the problem. It's a complex issue with no single, easy solution. It requires a collaborative effort across the entire scientific community.  Um... it's a long-term project, really.  You know, changing research culture takes time.
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  So, the problem with the older methods of antibody production – using immune cells or hybrids – is that the process is inherently variable. You get batches of antibodies that aren't exactly the same, and that's a huge issue for reproducibility.  Recombinant antibodies are different. They're made using genetically engineered cells that are *programmed* to produce a specific antibody.  Think of it like having a precise recipe, instead of relying on a less consistent natural process.  This means you get a consistent product, batch after batch.  The sequence is known, the structure is known, and therefore the function should be more predictable.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like... mass-producing a perfectly cloned antibody, rather than relying on a more organic, less predictable method?
[INFO] Joe: You could say that, although "cloned" might not be the most precise term. It's more about precisely controlling the production process at a genetic level, ensuring consistency.  The older methods are more like farming – you get a harvest, but the quality and quantity can vary.  Recombinant production is more like a factory assembly line –  much more controlled and standardized.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, that makes sense. So, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them?  It sounds like there's still some resistance.
[INFO] Joe: That's the frustrating part.  Part of it is inertia; researchers may be comfortable with what they're already using.  There's also the cost factor; recombinant antibodies can sometimes be more expensive upfront. But there's also the issue of changing established practices.  Scientists, like anyone else, can be resistant to change, even if that change would significantly improve the quality of their work.  It's a cultural shift that's needed, as much as a technological one.   And then, of course, there's the issue of validating these new antibodies, which takes additional time and resources.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not just a scientific problem, it's also a sociological one.  That's interesting.  So, the initiatives mentioned, like the OGA community and the work of organizations like NC3Rs, are trying to address both the scientific and the social aspects of this problem?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. They're tackling the problem from multiple angles – improving the technology, incentivizing better practices, and fostering a community focused on improvement and sharing best practices.  It's a systemic issue, and it requires a multi-faceted solution.  It's really encouraging to see so much effort being put into this.
[INFO] Sarah: It really is.  Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful.  I feel much clearer on the challenges and the solutions being implemented.
[INFO] Sarah: It really is. Thanks, Joe. This has been incredibly insightful. I feel much clearer on the challenges and the solutions being implemented.  So, you mentioned several ways researchers validate antibodies.  Can you walk me through them again, but maybe a little slower this time?  I want to make sure I’ve got it.
[INFO] Joe: Sure thing, Sarah.  So, there are a few key methods.  Um… the first is immunohistochemistry, or IHC.  Essentially, you're using the antibody to see if it binds to the specific protein in a sample of cells.  If the antibody *does* bind, it'll essentially "label" those cells, making them visible under a microscope.  So you're directly visualizing the protein's location within the cells.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it's like… highlighting the protein?  Is that a fair way to think about it?
[INFO] Joe: You could say that, yeah.  It’s a visual confirmation.  It shows you *where* the protein is.  Then, there's Western blotting. This one's a bit different.  Here, you separate proteins by size using gel electrophoresis, and then you use the antibody to see if it binds to a specific protein with a known molecular weight.  Think of it like… you're looking for a specific sized package in a pile of packages.  The antibody is your way of finding that one specific package.
[INFO] Sarah: So, in Western blotting, you're not looking at the protein *in* the cells, but rather a purified sample of proteins, right?  And you're confirming the *size* of the protein as well as its presence?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. You're confirming both its presence and its size.  It’s a different kind of verification.  And then, finally, there’s immunoprecipitation. This is where things get a little more complex.  You use the antibody to essentially fish out the specific protein from a complex mixture of proteins.  Think of it as using a magnet to pull out a specific type of metal from a pile of different metals.  Once you've isolated the protein, you can then use mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  That gives you a very precise identification.
[INFO] Sarah: So, each method offers a different level of confirmation, right? IHC is visual, Western blotting checks size and presence, and immunoprecipitation isolates and identifies. That’s a pretty robust validation process, then.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  Using multiple methods gives you a much more reliable result.  One method alone might leave room for doubt, but using all three provides a much stronger confirmation that your antibody is indeed targeting the correct protein.  It’s about building confidence in your results.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes a lot more sense now. Thanks for explaining it so clearly.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous validation in scientific research.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's crucial.  You know, science isn't always straightforward; there are layers of verification.  We need to be confident in our tools.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely.  This has been incredibly helpful.

[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely. It's a systemic problem, and it requires a systemic solution.  It's fascinating how much effort is going into fixing this, though.  It highlights the importance of reproducibility in science, and the lengths researchers are going to to improve it.  It gives me hope, actually.  Thanks, Joe. This has been really helpful.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a lot of information! So, to summarize, the main issue is the unreliability of antibodies in research, right?  And the solution seems to be a multi-pronged approach –  better manufacturing, improved data sharing, and even changing researcher behavior.  But Joe, can you break down the "recombinant antibodies" part for me?  What makes them so much better?
