Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.

Sarah:  Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?

Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.

Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?

Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!

Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?

Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.


Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?

Joe:  Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.


Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

**Previous Context**:
My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.

**Sarah:**  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.

**Joe:**  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.

**Sarah:** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?

**Joe:** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.

**Joe:**  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.

**Sarah:**  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.

**Joe:**  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.

**Sarah:** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?

**Joe:**  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.

**Sarah:**  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 **(Intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?

**Joe:**  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.  

**Sarah:**  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?

**Joe:** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.

**Sarah:**  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?

**Joe:** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.

**Sarah:**  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?

**Joe:** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.

**Sarah:** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.

**Sarah:**  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

    "text": "** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers."

** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?

**Sarah:** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?

**Joe:**  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.

**Sarah:**  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?

**Joe:** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?

**Joe:**  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.

**Sarah:**  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.

**Joe:**  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.

**Sarah:**  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.

**Joe:**  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.

**Sarah:** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?

**Joe:** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.

**Sarah:**  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.

**Sarah:** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.

**Joe:** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.


**Sarah:** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.


**Joe:** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.


**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a little frustrating—area of biomedical research: the reliability of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Antibodies?  Um, I know they're important in, like, our immune systems, but I'm not sure I fully grasp their role in research.  Could you give me a quick rundown?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, antibodies are, uh, essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific molecules, right?  Think of them as tiny, highly specific, molecular tags.  In research, scientists use them to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells or tissues.  They're crucial for all sorts of experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what's the problem?
[INFO] Joe: The problem, Sarah, is that for decades, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy for their research—simply haven't worked as advertised.  Many don't bind to the intended target protein specifically, or they bind to other things too, leading to inaccurate results.  This is a huge issue.  One study highlighted this perfectly.  Carl Laflamme, a researcher, was studying a protein linked to motor neuron disease. He wanted to know where this protein was located in the cell, but the existing antibodies available simply weren't reliable.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly binding to this protein, and only three actually worked.  And, get this,  fifteen papers used an antibody that *didn't* even bind to the right protein!  Those papers had been cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Thousands of times! That’s… alarming.  So, is it just a case of bad manufacturing, or is there something more systemic going on?
[INFO] Joe: It's a bit of both, I think.  There's certainly been a lack of rigorous quality control in the past.  But it's also a systemic problem.  There hasn't been a standardized way of testing antibodies, and there wasn't a central repository where researchers could easily find reliable ones.  It's led to wasted time, resources, and, potentially, inaccurate conclusions. Some even argue it's contributed to a reproducibility crisis in the field.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there hope?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely! There's a growing movement to address this.  Initiatives like iCharOS—that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science—are working to systematically characterize commercially available antibodies.  They're testing them rigorously and making the data publicly available.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and make it easier for researchers to find reliable ones.  It's a huge undertaking, but there's definitely momentum building.  It’s a really positive step, although it's a long road ahead.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking.  It's almost like they're trying to rebuild the foundation of a large part of biomedical research, huh?  It's reassuring to hear there's hope though!  Thanks, Joe. This has been really enlightening.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody verification problem.  The sheer scale of it – millions of antibodies, hundreds of suppliers… it's mind-boggling.  YCharOS's approach, focusing on a standardized knockout cell line comparison, is, you know, a really elegant solution to a very messy problem.
[INFO] Sarah: **  It is, isn't it? But I'm still grappling with the core methodology.  You mentioned a "knockout cell line." Can you explain that in a way that even *I* can understand?  No fancy analogies, please!  Just the straight facts.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  Imagine a cell, right? It normally produces a specific protein – let's say, Protein X.  A knockout cell line is essentially a genetically modified version of that cell.  Scientists have manipulated its DNA to prevent it from producing Protein X. So, you have two cell lines: one that *does* produce Protein X, and one that *doesn't*.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, I'm following.  So, YCharOS tests an antibody against both cell lines?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. If the antibody is specific to Protein X, it should only bind to the cells that *produce* Protein X. It shouldn't bind to the knockout cells, which lack Protein X.  That's the key to validating its specificity.  The absence of binding in the knockout cell line demonstrates the antibody’s selectivity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a control group, in a way?  A negative control.
[INFO] Joe: **  Precisely.  It's a crucial negative control.  It helps rule out false positives.  Without that control, you could easily get false positives – the antibody might bind to something else in the cell, giving a false impression of specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  But what about the other initiatives, like OMAPs?  They seem to be tackling the problem from a different angle.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yes, OMAPs takes a more application-focused approach.  Instead of rigorously characterizing antibodies in a single, standardized test like YCharOS, they validate antibodies across various tissue types and imaging techniques.  It's a broader, more contextual validation.  Think of YCharOS as a highly controlled lab test, while OMAPs is more like real-world testing in various environments.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, one is focused on inherent properties, while the other focuses on performance in different contexts?
[INFO] Joe: **  Exactly.  Both are valuable, addressing different aspects of antibody reliability.  YCharOS gives you a baseline measure of specificity and selectivity, while OMAPs provides information about its performance in different applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation.  It's like, you know, having both a lab report and real-world user reviews for a product.
[INFO] Sarah: **  That's a really helpful analogy, actually.  Thanks, Joe.  This has been incredibly enlightening.  I think I finally understand the nuances of antibody validation.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Sarah: ** Welcome back to Science Odyssey, everyone! Today, we're diving deep into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies with Joe, who's been patiently explaining the challenges researchers face in finding reliable ones. Joe, where were we?
[INFO] Joe: **  Right, so we were talking about the reproducibility crisis in research, specifically the huge problem with antibodies. You know,  it's not just about finding them; it's about *knowing* they're actually doing what they're supposed to do.  We discussed how even highly cited antibodies can be unreliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Exactly!  And that's mind-blowing. I mean, these are fundamental tools in so much biological research.  So, what are the main obstacles researchers face when trying to find reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: ** Well, there are several. One major issue is the lack of standardized identification.  Before initiatives like RRIDs,  identifying a specific antibody was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Catalogue numbers from manufacturers often disappear, or multiple products might share the same number, making it nearly impossible to replicate experiments. RRIDs are designed to solve this – they provide unique, persistent identifiers.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, RRIDs are like permanent, universal product codes for antibodies?  That makes a lot of sense. It seems like such a simple solution, yet it addresses a huge problem.  But even with RRIDs, how do you know an antibody is *actually* good?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's the bigger hurdle.  Even with proper identification, you need validation.  Some validation methods, like knockout validation, are considered gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies have undergone that rigorous process.  It's a significant issue.  Many researchers rely on citation counts, but that's not a guarantee of quality.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, citation counts are a bit like popularity contests, not necessarily a reflection of actual reliability.  That's a pretty disheartening realization for anyone relying on published research.  What are researchers and organizations doing to tackle this problem?
[INFO] Joe: ** Um, there are several initiatives. CiteAb, for example, is a search engine that tries to aggregate information on antibody performance, including citations and, increasingly, validation data.  Then there's the Only Good Antibodies community, which brings together researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies to collaboratively address this issue. They're trying to establish better standards and encourage more rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That’s encouraging to hear about collaborative efforts. It sounds like a complex problem that requires a multifaceted solution.  Is there anything else researchers can do individually to increase their chances of using reliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  Careful scrutiny of the available data, using multiple antibodies to confirm results, and prioritizing those with independent validation are all crucial steps.  It's a time-consuming process, but it's essential for reliable results.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's a bit like due diligence, but on a scientific scale.  It requires more time and effort upfront, but it pays off in the long run with more trustworthy research.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this critical issue. This has been incredibly insightful.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey. Join us next time as we explore...
[INFO] Joe: ** So, Sarah, we were talking about antibodies, and the… uh…  the fascinating challenges in ensuring their reliability in research.  It's a complex area, isn't it?
[INFO] Sarah: ** It really is, Joe.  And I think what struck me most is this push towards recombinant antibodies.  Can you explain, in plain English, why they're considered so much better than the older methods?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure.  The older methods often involved generating antibodies from, you know,  immune cells or hybridomas – these are essentially cells that produce antibodies. The problem is, the process isn't perfectly controlled. Each batch of antibodies produced this way can vary slightly in its composition and therefore, its performance.  Think of it like baking a cake – if you don’t precisely measure ingredients every time, each cake will be slightly different.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Okay, I see.  So, inconsistency is the main issue?
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly. Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced using genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence. This means you get a highly consistent product, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe and following it perfectly each time you bake. You get the same result consistently.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s all about standardization and reproducibility.  That makes a lot of sense. But, if recombinant antibodies are so much better, why aren't all researchers using them already?
[INFO] Joe: **  That’s a great question, and it highlights the bigger picture.  It's not just about the technology; it’s about the cost, the existing infrastructure, and, frankly, the inertia within the research community.  Switching over requires significant effort and investment. Some researchers might be hesitant to change established protocols, even if the new methods offer clear advantages.  There's a comfort level with the familiar, even if it's less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it’s a bit like…  people sticking with an old, clunky computer even though a new, faster model is available?  They know how the old one works, even if it’s inefficient.
[INFO] Joe: **  Yeah, that’s a pretty good analogy, actually. Although, I'd add that there's also the issue of validation.  Researchers need to validate that these new recombinant antibodies perform as expected in their specific experiments.  That adds another layer of complexity and time.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Right, so it's not just a simple switch. There's a learning curve, a cost factor, and the need for validation.  This whole thing highlights the importance of collaboration and information sharing within the scientific community, doesn't it?  Making data about antibody quality more readily available seems crucial.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  Open data sharing, standardized validation protocols, and incentives for researchers to adopt best practices are all crucial steps in moving towards more reliable and reproducible research. It's a collective effort.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, we’ve been talking about the reproducibility crisis in science, and you’ve mentioned several ways researchers validate their antibodies.  Can you maybe just… you know… walk us through those again, but a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure, Sarah.  So, the core problem is making sure an antibody actually binds to *only* the protein it’s supposed to.  We don't want false positives, right?  So, there are a few key techniques.  First, immunohistochemistry...  that's where you basically stain cells. If your antibody is working correctly, you should only see staining in cells that actually *have* that specific protein.  It's like… well, it's not really like anything else, it's a pretty specific technique.  You're looking for a visual confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, so it's a visual check to see if the antibody is binding where it should be.  Simple enough. What about the other methods?
[INFO] Joe: ** Right.  Then there's Western blotting. This is a bit different. Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of a specific size – the expected molecular weight of your target protein. If it does, and it's only one band, that's a good sign.  Think of it like… if you're looking for a specific sized Lego brick, and you find only that one, it's more likely you found the right one.  Though, even then, there's always a chance of error.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, you’re essentially weighing the protein, and confirming the antibody only sticks to one specific weight? That makes more sense.  And the last one was… immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: ** Yes. Immunoprecipitation is a bit more complex.  You use the antibody to literally *pull out* the protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of that pulled-out protein.  It's like fishing, I guess, but instead of a fish, you're catching a specific protein.  It's a more rigorous way to confirm the antibody's specificity.  You're not just seeing if it *might* bind, you're isolating and identifying the target.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, using multiple methods is really important for confirming the results, right?  It’s a bit like triangulation – getting confirmation from multiple independent sources.
[INFO] Joe: ** Exactly.  The more validation methods you use, the more confident you can be that your antibody is specific and reliable.  And that’s crucial for getting trustworthy research results. It’s all about minimizing those false positives and negatives.
[INFO] Sarah: ** It sounds like a lot of work, and honestly, it highlights just how much care and attention to detail goes into even the most basic steps of scientific research.  This really puts the reproducibility crisis into perspective.
[INFO] Joe: ** Absolutely.  And that's why open data sharing and standardized protocols are so important.  It helps everyone ensure the reliability of the work.  It's a collective effort to improve the overall quality of research.
[INFO] Sarah: **  Absolutely.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly enlightening.  Thank you for breaking it all down for us.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, antibodies.  I've heard whispers about this being a big problem.  Um, can you explain what the issue is, in, you know, plain English?  I'm not a scientist.

Joe:  Sure, Sarah. So, scientists use antibodies, which are essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific things, like viruses, to, um, identify and measure specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as tiny, highly specific tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy and use in their labs—don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the *right* protein, or they might bind to multiple proteins, giving you inaccurate results.

Sarah:  So, they're like... faulty tools?  Giving you bad data?

Joe: Exactly!  And that's a huge problem.  It leads to wasted time, money, and, more importantly, potentially flawed research findings.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, found that, um, out of sixteen commercially available antibodies designed to target a specific protein related to motor neuron disease, only three actually worked correctly.  Fifteen others didn't even bind to the target protein.  And those fifteen faulty antibodies had been cited in over 3000 published papers!

Sarah:  Wow. Three thousand papers! That's... mind-boggling.  So, what causes this? Is it just bad manufacturing?

Joe:  It's a complex issue.  Part of it is the manufacturing process, for sure.  But it's also about the testing and validation of these antibodies.  Historically, there hasn't been enough rigorous testing to ensure the quality and specificity of these antibodies before they hit the market.  And, you know, it's not always easy to tell if an antibody is working correctly.  The methods for testing can be quite complicated.

Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?

Joe: Ah, that's where things get more hopeful.  There are several initiatives springing up.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS, which aims to thoroughly test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.  There are also efforts to improve the manufacturing processes and to encourage better practices within the scientific community.  Things like more rigorous testing and better transparency in reporting results.

Sarah:  It sounds like a huge collaborative effort is needed, then.  Vendors, researchers, funding agencies...everyone needs to be on board.

Joe: Absolutely. It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.  And, you know, it's not just about fixing the problem for future research.  There's also a need to revisit some of the existing research findings that might be based on unreliable antibodies.  It's a bit of a cleanup operation, but a necessary one for the advancement of scientific knowledge.

Sarah:  This is a really fascinating, and a bit alarming, look into the inner workings of scientific research. Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe.  It really highlights the importance of careful methodology and verification in science.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue that needs more attention, and I hope our listeners will find this conversation insightful.  Until next time, this is Science Odyssey signing off.

My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue that needs more attention, and I hope our listeners will find this conversation insightful.  Until next time, this is Science Odyssey signing off.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 **(Sound of a gentle transition, then silence)**

Joe: So, Sarah, picking up where we left off… the antibody validation crisis is a pretty significant problem, isn’t it?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a surprisingly large proportion simply don't perform as advertised.

Sarah: Exactly. It's astounding, really.  I mean, you're talking about the foundation of so much biological research.  And yet, we've had this massive proliferation of antibodies with questionable reliability.  This YCharOS initiative, though… it seems like a significant step forward.  But can you explain, in simple terms, what sets their approach apart?  I understand they're collaborating extensively with vendors, which is unusual.

Joe:  Right.  What makes YCharOS different is their scale and systematic approach.  They're not just testing a few antibodies here and there. They're actively engaging with a large number of antibody suppliers. This collaboration is key because the suppliers provide the antibodies for testing – free of charge.  And, you know, this level of cooperation is unprecedented.

Sarah:  That's…  a huge commitment from the vendors. What's the incentive for them?  Are they just being altruistic?  Or is there a strategic benefit?

Joe: Well, it’s a combination of things, I think.  Firstly,  participating helps ensure the quality of their products.  Identifying and fixing flawed antibodies benefits everyone in the long run –  it improves the reliability of research and ultimately, the reputation of the vendors themselves.  It's a bit of a self-regulating mechanism, if you will.  Also, the collaborative review process allows vendors to provide feedback before reports are published, which is valuable for them.

Sarah: So, it's a kind of quality control, but on a much larger and more collaborative scale than we've seen before.  What about their testing methodology?  You mentioned something about knock-out cell lines...

Joe:  Yes, their method is quite straightforward.  They compare antibody performance in two different cell lines: one that expresses the target protein normally, and a "knock-out" line that lacks the protein.  This allows them to directly assess the specificity of the antibody – its ability to bind *only* to the intended target.  The absence of binding in the knock-out cell line confirms that the antibody isn't picking up other things.

Sarah:  That sounds incredibly rigorous.  And the results, as you mentioned earlier, were... concerning?

Joe: To put it mildly. Their initial analysis showed that a significant percentage – two-thirds – of the antibodies tested didn't perform as claimed by the manufacturers.  That's a huge red flag for the entire research community.

Sarah:  It really is. And it highlights the importance of those negative controls, as the YCharOS director mentioned.  But how sustainable is this YCharOS model?  It seems like a massive undertaking.

Joe: That's a valid concern. The scale is certainly ambitious.  The long-term sustainability will depend on continued funding and, critically, the ongoing commitment from both the vendors and the funding bodies.  It's a large-scale effort, but if it can continue, it could dramatically improve the reliability of antibody-based research.  There are other initiatives like OMAPs, which focus on validation in different contexts, not just the basic specificity.  So it's not a single solution, but a multi-pronged approach is needed.

Sarah:  It sounds like a vital piece of the puzzle, though.  A much-needed quality control system for a crucial research tool.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe. That was incredibly clear.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it for our listeners.

My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it for our listeners.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the problems with antibody reliability.  It sounds incredibly frustrating.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers – as a step towards improvement.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  I’m still a little fuzzy on it.

Joe:  Sure.  Think of it like this... well, maybe not "think of it like this," because analogies can be misleading.  Basically, RRIDs are unique identifying codes for research resources, like antibodies.  Currently, companies often assign their own catalogue numbers to antibodies, which can change or even disappear if the company stops making that specific antibody.  Different companies might even use the same number for different antibodies.  It's a mess.  RRIDs are persistent, unique identifiers. They're like a permanent, globally recognized address for each antibody.  It makes it much easier to find and track down the exact antibody used in a study, improving reproducibility.

Sarah: So, it's essentially a standardized, permanent labeling system?  That makes a lot more sense.  But even with proper labeling, it sounds like a lot of antibodies aren't actually very good, even the ones that are widely cited.  What's the core issue there?  Is it just poor manufacturing?

Joe:  It's more complicated than just poor manufacturing, although that certainly plays a role.  The problem is that antibodies are used in so many different contexts – different species, different tissues, different experimental setups.  An antibody that works perfectly for one application might be completely useless for another.  There isn't a single, universally accepted validation method.  Some people emphasize "knock-out validation," but even that's not foolproof, and it's only done for a tiny percentage of antibodies.

Sarah:  So, there's no easy "good" or "bad" label we can just slap on an antibody? It really depends on the specific use case. That's a huge hurdle.

Joe: Exactly. And that’s why initiatives like CiteAb, which is a search engine for antibodies, are so important. They are trying to gather data on how different antibodies perform in various situations.  They're incorporating validation data, but again, it's a massive undertaking. It’s not just about the manufacturers, either; it’s a system-wide problem.

Sarah:  Right.  And then you mentioned this "Only Good Antibodies" community.  What's their approach?  Are they trying to create some kind of universal standard?

Joe:  Their approach is more collaborative. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers to work together on solutions.  They're not trying to impose a single standard, but to foster better communication and data sharing to improve the reliability of antibodies across the board. It’s a much needed holistic approach, you know?  It's about improving the whole process, not just one aspect of it.  It's a long-term project, but it's a crucial one.

Sarah:  It sounds like a monumental task.  But it's encouraging to hear about these initiatives trying to tackle this problem head-on.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly helpful.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Sarah: Wow, that's a lot to unpack.  So, Joe, let's try to simplify this.  You mentioned recombinant antibodies being a big deal. Can you explain what makes them different, and why they're such an improvement?

Joe:  Right.  So, traditionally, many antibodies were made using, um,  immune cells or hybridomas – basically, cells that produce antibodies naturally.  The problem is, this process is inherently variable.  Each batch of antibodies might be slightly different in terms of its purity and how effectively it binds to its target.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to make *only* a specific antibody. This means you get a consistent product every time, batch after batch.  It's like having a precise recipe instead of a vague guideline.

Sarah:  So, it's the consistency that's key then?  Less variability means more reliable results in experiments?

Joe: Exactly.  Less variability translates directly to more reproducible results.  Think of it this way: if you're building something, you want consistent bricks, not bricks of varying sizes and shapes.  Inconsistent antibodies are like those inconsistent bricks – they make the whole research structure less reliable.

Sarah: Makes perfect sense.  But even with these improvements, you mentioned that getting scientists to actually *use* these better antibodies is a hurdle. Why is that?

Joe: Yeah, that's a huge challenge.  Some researchers might be hesitant to change established methods, even if there's evidence that a new method is superior.  There's also the issue of inertia –  if an antibody has worked for them in the past, they may not see the need to switch.  And let's be honest, sometimes it's just easier to stick with what you know. There's also the issue of publication bias – where papers using newer, potentially more reliable methods are less likely to be published because they don't show novel or exciting results.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of habit, convenience, and perhaps even some systemic issues within scientific publishing? That's... depressing, to be honest.

Joe:  It is, but there's also a lot of positive momentum. You know, initiatives like the ones we discussed are actively trying to address this.  Rewarding researchers for using better antibodies, improving data sharing... these are all steps in the right direction.  The shift towards recombinant antibodies is already happening, albeit slowly.  And the younger generation of scientists seem more collaborative and open to adopting these best practices, which is very encouraging.  It's a slow burn, but progress is being made.

Sarah: That’s good to hear.  I think it's important for our listeners to understand that even within the scientific community, change doesn't happen overnight. It's a process of incremental improvements and overcoming resistance to change.  Thanks so much for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really insightful.

Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah: That’s good to hear.  I think it's important for our listeners to understand that even within the scientific community, change doesn't happen overnight. It's a process of incremental improvements and overcoming resistance to change.  Thanks so much for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really insightful.

Joe:  Yeah, absolutely.  And you're right, it's not like a light switch.  It’s… um…  a gradual process,  lots of small steps forward.  Speaking of which, we were talking about validating antibodies, right?  There are several key methods researchers use to check if an antibody is actually doing what it's supposed to.

Sarah: Right, the reliability of those antibodies.  So, you mentioned a few methods. Can you break them down a bit more for our listeners?  Maybe explain them in a way that isn't too… technical?

Joe: Okay, so, one common method is immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you're staining cells.  If the antibody is good, it will bind specifically to the protein you're interested in within those cells.  You can then see under a microscope which cells are expressing that protein.

Sarah:  So, it’s like… highlighting the protein?  A visual confirmation?

Joe:  Yeah, you could think of it that way, I guess.  But it's more precise than just highlighting.  It's about specific binding. Another method is Western blotting.  Here, you separate proteins by size using a gel, and then the antibody is used to detect the protein of interest.  If the antibody is specific, it'll only bind to that one protein with a specific molecular weight.  You'll see a single band on the blot if it works.

Sarah:  So, a single band means the antibody is working correctly?  And if you get multiple bands, that's a problem?

Joe:  Exactly. Multiple bands usually means the antibody is binding to other things besides your target protein, which isn't ideal.  It lacks specificity.  And then there's immunoprecipitation.  This is where you use the antibody to physically pull out your protein of interest from a complex mixture of proteins.  Then, you can use mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the protein you pulled out.  It’s like fishing for a specific protein using the antibody as your bait.

Sarah:  Okay, that makes more sense now.  So, you're using multiple techniques to cross-validate, right?  To make sure the results are reliable and consistent?

Joe: Precisely.  Using multiple methods increases confidence in your findings.  It's all about building up evidence to support the antibody's reliability.

Sarah: It sounds like a lot of work!  And it highlights the importance of rigorous validation.  This really helps clarify the process for listeners.

Joe:  It is a lot of work, and that's why it's so crucial to get it right.  The reliability of the antibodies is fundamental to the entire research process. Um… you know… getting that wrong can throw off everything else.

Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for explaining that, Joe. This has been incredibly helpful.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  Today, we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, antibodies.  I've heard whispers about this being a big problem.  Um, can you explain what the issue is, in, you know, plain English?  I'm not a scientist.
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah. So, scientists use antibodies, which are essentially proteins produced by our immune systems to target specific things, like viruses, to, um, identify and measure specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as tiny, highly specific tags.  The problem is, many commercially available antibodies—the ones scientists buy and use in their labs—don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the *right* protein, or they might bind to multiple proteins, giving you inaccurate results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, they're like... faulty tools?  Giving you bad data?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  And that's a huge problem.  It leads to wasted time, money, and, more importantly, potentially flawed research findings.  One researcher, Carl Laflamme, found that, um, out of sixteen commercially available antibodies designed to target a specific protein related to motor neuron disease, only three actually worked correctly.  Fifteen others didn't even bind to the target protein.  And those fifteen faulty antibodies had been cited in over 3000 published papers!
[INFO] Joe: It's a complex issue.  Part of it is the manufacturing process, for sure.  But it's also about the testing and validation of these antibodies.  Historically, there hasn't been enough rigorous testing to ensure the quality and specificity of these antibodies before they hit the market.  And, you know, it's not always easy to tell if an antibody is working correctly.  The methods for testing can be quite complicated.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. Three thousand papers! That's... mind-boggling.  So, what causes this? Is it just bad manufacturing?
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?
[INFO] Joe: Ah, that's where things get more hopeful.  There are several initiatives springing up.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS, which aims to thoroughly test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It's a massive undertaking, but it's crucial.  There are also efforts to improve the manufacturing processes and to encourage better practices within the scientific community.  Things like more rigorous testing and better transparency in reporting results.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a huge collaborative effort is needed, then.  Vendors, researchers, funding agencies...everyone needs to be on board.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely. It's a systemic problem requiring a systemic solution.  And, you know, it's not just about fixing the problem for future research.  There's also a need to revisit some of the existing research findings that might be based on unreliable antibodies.  It's a bit of a cleanup operation, but a necessary one for the advancement of scientific knowledge.
[INFO] Sarah: This is a really fascinating, and a bit alarming, look into the inner workings of scientific research. Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe.  It really highlights the importance of careful methodology and verification in science.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a crucial issue that needs more attention, and I hope our listeners will find this conversation insightful.  Until next time, this is Science Odyssey signing off.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, picking up where we left off… the antibody validation crisis is a pretty significant problem, isn’t it?  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a surprisingly large proportion simply don't perform as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly. It's astounding, really.  I mean, you're talking about the foundation of so much biological research.  And yet, we've had this massive proliferation of antibodies with questionable reliability.  This YCharOS initiative, though… it seems like a significant step forward.  But can you explain, in simple terms, what sets their approach apart?  I understand they're collaborating extensively with vendors, which is unusual.
[INFO] Joe: Right.  What makes YCharOS different is their scale and systematic approach.  They're not just testing a few antibodies here and there. They're actively engaging with a large number of antibody suppliers. This collaboration is key because the suppliers provide the antibodies for testing – free of charge.  And, you know, this level of cooperation is unprecedented.
[INFO] Sarah: That's…  a huge commitment from the vendors. What's the incentive for them?  Are they just being altruistic?  Or is there a strategic benefit?
[INFO] Joe: Well, it’s a combination of things, I think.  Firstly,  participating helps ensure the quality of their products.  Identifying and fixing flawed antibodies benefits everyone in the long run –  it improves the reliability of research and ultimately, the reputation of the vendors themselves.  It's a bit of a self-regulating mechanism, if you will.  Also, the collaborative review process allows vendors to provide feedback before reports are published, which is valuable for them.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a kind of quality control, but on a much larger and more collaborative scale than we've seen before.  What about their testing methodology?  You mentioned something about knock-out cell lines...
[INFO] Joe: Yes, their method is quite straightforward.  They compare antibody performance in two different cell lines: one that expresses the target protein normally, and a "knock-out" line that lacks the protein.  This allows them to directly assess the specificity of the antibody – its ability to bind *only* to the intended target.  The absence of binding in the knock-out cell line confirms that the antibody isn't picking up other things.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds incredibly rigorous.  And the results, as you mentioned earlier, were... concerning?
[INFO] Joe: To put it mildly. Their initial analysis showed that a significant percentage – two-thirds – of the antibodies tested didn't perform as claimed by the manufacturers.  That's a huge red flag for the entire research community.
[INFO] Sarah: It really is. And it highlights the importance of those negative controls, as the YCharOS director mentioned.  But how sustainable is this YCharOS model?  It seems like a massive undertaking.
[INFO] Joe: That's a valid concern. The scale is certainly ambitious.  The long-term sustainability will depend on continued funding and, critically, the ongoing commitment from both the vendors and the funding bodies.  It's a large-scale effort, but if it can continue, it could dramatically improve the reliability of antibody-based research.  There are other initiatives like OMAPs, which focus on validation in different contexts, not just the basic specificity.  So it's not a single solution, but a multi-pronged approach is needed.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a vital piece of the puzzle, though.  A much-needed quality control system for a crucial research tool.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe. That was incredibly clear.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex issue, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it for our listeners.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, we've talked about the problems with antibody reliability.  It sounds incredibly frustrating.  You mentioned RRIDs – research resource identifiers – as a step towards improvement.  Can you explain that a bit more simply?  I’m still a little fuzzy on it.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's essentially a standardized, permanent labeling system?  That makes a lot more sense.  But even with proper labeling, it sounds like a lot of antibodies aren't actually very good, even the ones that are widely cited.  What's the core issue there?  Is it just poor manufacturing?
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Think of it like this... well, maybe not "think of it like this," because analogies can be misleading.  Basically, RRIDs are unique identifying codes for research resources, like antibodies.  Currently, companies often assign their own catalogue numbers to antibodies, which can change or even disappear if the company stops making that specific antibody.  Different companies might even use the same number for different antibodies.  It's a mess.  RRIDs are persistent, unique identifiers. They're like a permanent, globally recognized address for each antibody.  It makes it much easier to find and track down the exact antibody used in a study, improving reproducibility.
[INFO] Joe: It's more complicated than just poor manufacturing, although that certainly plays a role.  The problem is that antibodies are used in so many different contexts – different species, different tissues, different experimental setups.  An antibody that works perfectly for one application might be completely useless for another.  There isn't a single, universally accepted validation method.  Some people emphasize "knock-out validation," but even that's not foolproof, and it's only done for a tiny percentage of antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: So, there's no easy "good" or "bad" label we can just slap on an antibody? It really depends on the specific use case. That's a huge hurdle.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. And that’s why initiatives like CiteAb, which is a search engine for antibodies, are so important. They are trying to gather data on how different antibodies perform in various situations.  They're incorporating validation data, but again, it's a massive undertaking. It’s not just about the manufacturers, either; it’s a system-wide problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  And then you mentioned this "Only Good Antibodies" community.  What's their approach?  Are they trying to create some kind of universal standard?
[INFO] Joe: Their approach is more collaborative. They're bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers to work together on solutions.  They're not trying to impose a single standard, but to foster better communication and data sharing to improve the reliability of antibodies across the board. It’s a much needed holistic approach, you know?  It's about improving the whole process, not just one aspect of it.  It's a long-term project, but it's a crucial one.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a monumental task.  But it's encouraging to hear about these initiatives trying to tackle this problem head-on.  Thanks for explaining all that, Joe.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly helpful.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's a lot to unpack.  So, Joe, let's try to simplify this.  You mentioned recombinant antibodies being a big deal. Can you explain what makes them different, and why they're such an improvement?
[INFO] Joe: Right.  So, traditionally, many antibodies were made using, um,  immune cells or hybridomas – basically, cells that produce antibodies naturally.

Inconsistent antibodies are like those inconsistent bricks – they make the whole research structure less reliable.
[INFO] Sarah: Makes perfect sense.  But even with these improvements, you mentioned that getting scientists to actually *use* these better antibodies is a hurdle. Why is that?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's a huge challenge.  Some researchers might be hesitant to change established methods, even if there's evidence that a new method is superior.  There's also the issue of inertia –  if an antibody has worked for them in the past, they may not see the need to switch.  And let's be honest, sometimes it's just easier to stick with what you know. There's also the issue of publication bias – where papers using newer, potentially more reliable methods are less likely to be published because they don't show novel or exciting results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of habit, convenience, and perhaps even some systemic issues within scientific publishing? That's... depressing, to be honest.

[INFO] Sarah: That’s good to hear.  I think it's important for our listeners to understand that even within the scientific community, change doesn't happen overnight. It's a process of incremental improvements and overcoming resistance to change.  Thanks so much for explaining all this, Joe.  This has been really insightful.
