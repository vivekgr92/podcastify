Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that directly linked to unreliable antibodies?

Joe:  Um, yeah, it's a significant contributor.  You see, scientists rely heavily on antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  But, and this is a big but, many commercially available antibodies just don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein strongly enough, or worse, they bind to other proteins entirely, giving you completely false results.

Sarah:  So, false positives, basically?  That's... concerning. I mean, how many studies could be affected by this?

Joe:  Exactly.  It's incredibly concerning.  One study highlighted the case of a single antibody used in over fifteen papers, cited over 3000 times! And guess what?  That antibody didn't even bind to the intended protein.  It was completely useless for the purpose it was used in those papers.  Think of the wasted time, resources, and the potential for misleading conclusions... it's a huge problem.

Sarah:  Wow. That's... a shocking number.  So, what's being done to address this?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the antibody manufacturers?

Joe:  It's a multifaceted problem, so the solutions are multifaceted too.  Yes, better quality control from manufacturers is crucial. But it's not just that.  There's a growing movement towards open science initiatives, like iCharOS – that's pronounced "Icarus" –  which aims to systematically test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It’s a massive undertaking.

Sarah: That sounds like a Herculean task!  But incredibly important. So, are researchers just blindly trusting the manufacturers' claims now, or are there ways to verify the antibodies independently?

Joe:  Ah, that's a great question.  Ideally, researchers should always independently validate the antibodies they use.  But, um, that's often not done, or it's not done rigorously enough.  Part of the problem is the lack of readily available, well-characterized antibodies.  iCharOS and similar initiatives are trying to change that by providing a public database of validated antibodies.

Sarah:  So, it's a combination of better manufacturing, better testing, and increased transparency and collaboration?

Joe: Exactly! It’s a systems problem that needs a systems solution.  It requires better standards, more rigorous testing, and a shift in the research culture towards greater scrutiny and sharing of data.  It’s a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like iCharOS are paving the way for more reliable research and, ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.

Sarah:  It's certainly a crucial step.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's much clearer now why this antibody issue is such a big deal.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.

It's certainly a crucial step.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's much clearer now why this antibody issue is such a big deal.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, you mentioned the YCharOS initiative and its impact on antibody validation.  It's a really significant effort, you know?  Their approach of comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – that's crucial for establishing specificity.  It directly addresses the problem of false positives, which, as we discussed earlier, can completely derail research.

Sarah:  Right.  But it makes me wonder,  how scalable is this method?  I mean, they've tested over a thousand antibodies, which is impressive, but there are millions on the market.  Is this kind of rigorous testing feasible for every single antibody?  And what about antibodies targeting less-studied proteins?  Would the availability of appropriate cell lines be a limiting factor?

Joe: That's a great point.  Scalability is definitely a challenge.  The process is labor-intensive, requiring careful cell culture, meticulous experimental design, and robust data analysis.  For less-studied proteins, finding suitable cell lines could indeed be difficult, potentially requiring the generation of new cell lines specifically for validation purposes. This adds another layer of complexity and cost.  And of course, the sheer number of antibodies is overwhelming.  It's not a simple matter of just scaling up the current process linearly.

Sarah:  So, what other approaches are there, then?  You mentioned OMAPs, which seems to tackle the problem from a different angle.

Joe:  Exactly. OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within specific applications, across different contexts.  Instead of aiming for universal validation, they concentrate on confirming performance within a defined set of experimental conditions – say, in various tissue types using a particular imaging technique. This is a more targeted approach, potentially more feasible for a larger scale, but it doesn't guarantee performance across the board.  It's a trade-off.

Sarah:  So it's like, YCharOS is aiming for broader, more fundamental validation, while OMAPs is more focused on application-specific validation?  Is that a fair summary?

Joe:  Yeah, pretty much.  YCharOS provides a strong foundation, showing whether the antibody binds to its intended target under controlled conditions.  OMAPs then builds upon that, validating performance in real-world applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation, but it’s a resource-intensive endeavor.

Sarah:  It's fascinating how these two approaches complement each other, almost like two sides of the same coin.  It really highlights the complexity of this issue and the need for multiple strategies to tackle it.  It sounds like a collaborative effort involving researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies is absolutely crucial.

Joe: Absolutely.  This isn't something any single group can solve on their own.  The scale of the problem demands a collaborative, multi-faceted approach.  And transparent data sharing, as YCharOS does, is critical to building trust and accelerating progress.  It's a bit of a messy problem, but the progress is encouraging.

And transparent data sharing, as YCharOS does, is critical to building trust and accelerating progress.  It's a bit of a messy problem, but the progress is encouraging.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: Okay, Joe, so we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned these RRIDs – Research Resource Identifiers –  to help track down antibodies. Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounds a bit… technical.

Joe:  Sure.  Think of it like this: every antibody, ideally, should have a unique ID number, like a barcode, that never changes.  Right now, companies often use their own catalog numbers, which can disappear if the company stops making that antibody, or even be duplicated by accident.  RRIDs are designed to be a permanent, universally recognized identifier for each antibody, regardless of the supplier. So, if someone publishes a paper using a specific antibody with its RRID, anyone else can easily find that exact same antibody years later, even if the original supplier is gone.  It's about creating a permanent record, you know?


Sarah:  So, it’s basically a standardized, persistent identifier to solve the problem of disappearing or duplicated catalog numbers.  That makes sense. But it sounds like even with RRIDs, identifying *good* antibodies is still a huge hurdle.  You mentioned CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies. How does that fit into the picture?

Joe:  Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but CiteAb helps you assess its quality. It's a database that compiles information on many antibodies, including citation counts.  The more a particular antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable. They're also starting to integrate data from YCharOS, which adds another layer of validation –  characterization data, showing exactly how the antibody performs.  It's not foolproof, of course.  But it provides researchers with much more information than they’ve had in the past to make informed decisions.

Sarah:  So, more data means better decisions.  But you also mentioned something about "knock-out validation." What's that?

Joe:  Knock-out validation is a very rigorous way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  Basically, you genetically modify cells to remove (knock out) the protein the antibody is supposed to detect.  If the antibody no longer binds to these modified cells, it confirms that it's specifically recognizing the target protein and not something else.  It's a gold standard, but unfortunately, very few antibodies have undergone this kind of validation.

Sarah:  It sounds incredibly thorough, but also, as you said, quite rare.  So, even with all these tools – RRIDs, CiteAb, and knock-out validation – we’re still far from a perfect solution, right?

Joe: Um, yeah.  It's a complex problem with no single, easy fix.  The good news is that there's a growing awareness of the issue and initiatives, like the Only Good Antibodies community, are bringing together stakeholders to work on solutions collaboratively.  It’s a messy, ongoing process, but progress is being made.  It's a bit like… well, maybe not like a puzzle, because that implies a neat solution.  It's more like…  a continuously evolving system needing constant refinement.

Sarah:  I think that’s a good way to put it.  A continuously evolving system.  It makes it clear that this isn’t a problem that will be solved overnight. Thanks, Joe, for explaining all that.

    "text": "Okay, Joe, so we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned these RRIDs – Research Resource Identifiers –  to help track down antibodies. Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounds a bit… technical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Sure.  Think of it like this: every antibody, ideally, should have a unique ID number, like a barcode, that never changes.  Right now, companies often use their own catalog numbers, which can disappear if the company stops making that antibody, or even be duplicated by accident.  RRIDs are designed to be a permanent, universally recognized identifier for each antibody, regardless of the supplier. So, if someone publishes a paper using a specific antibody with its RRID, anyone else can easily find that exact same antibody years later, even if the original supplier is gone.  It's about creating a permanent record, you know?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "So, it’s basically a standardized, persistent identifier to solve the problem of disappearing or duplicated catalog numbers.  That makes sense. But it sounds like even with RRIDs, identifying *good* antibodies is still a huge hurdle.  You mentioned CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies. How does that fit into the picture?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but CiteAb helps you assess its quality. It's a database that compiles information on many antibodies, including citation counts.  The more a particular antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable. They're also starting to integrate data from YCharOS, which adds another layer of validation –  characterization data, showing exactly how the antibody performs.  It's not foolproof, of course.  But it provides researchers with much more information than they’ve had in the past to make informed decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "So, more data means better decisions.  But you also mentioned something about \"knock-out validation.\" What's that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Knock-out validation is a very rigorous way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  Basically, you genetically modify cells to remove (knock out) the protein the antibody is supposed to detect.  If the antibody no longer binds to these modified cells, it confirms that it's specifically recognizing the target protein and not something else.  It's a gold standard, but unfortunately, very few antibodies have undergone this kind of validation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Sarah",
    "text": "It sounds incredibly thorough, but also, as you said, quite rare.  So, even with all these tools – RRIDs, CiteAb, and knock-out validation – we’re still far from a perfect solution, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Joe",
    "text": "Um, yeah.  It's a complex problem with no single, easy fix.  The good news is that there's a growing awareness of the issue and initiatives, like the Only Good Antibodies community, are bringing together stakeholders to work on solutions collaboratively.  It’s a messy, ongoing process, but progress is being made.  It's a bit like… well, maybe not like a puzzle, because that implies a neat solution.  It's more like…  a continuously evolving system needing constant refinement."

**Previous Context**:
I think that’s a good way to put it.  A continuously evolving system.  It makes it clear that this isn’t a problem that will be solved overnight. Thanks, Joe, for explaining all that.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: Okay, so we’ve talked about the challenges with antibody reliability, and the move towards recombinant antibodies seems like a big part of the solution.  But, you know, the article mentions that changing scientist behavior is still a huge hurdle.  Can you explain why that is so difficult, Joe?

Joe:  Yeah, it's a complex issue.  It boils down to a few things. First, there's inertia.  Scientists, like anyone else, often stick with what they know and what works, even if it's not ideal.  If an antibody has yielded results in the past, there's a reluctance to switch, even if there's evidence suggesting it might not be perfectly specific or reliable.  It takes time and effort to validate a new antibody, and researchers are often under pressure to publish, so they might prioritize speed over rigorous validation.

Sarah:  So it's a time and resource issue, right?  They're juggling deadlines and funding…

Joe: Exactly.  And then there's the issue of trust.  Some scientists might be hesitant to trust new antibodies, especially if they've had bad experiences with unreliable ones in the past.  Building trust in the new recombinant antibodies and the validation processes is crucial.  It's not just about the technology; it's about changing a culture of reliance on established, even if imperfect, methods.

Sarah: That makes sense.  It sounds like a classic case of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, even if it’s subtly broken.  But the article also talks about rewards for using best practices.  How effective do you think that approach is?

Joe:  Well, incentives can definitely help. Offering grants or other forms of recognition for adopting best practices can encourage scientists to invest the time and resources needed for validation.  Think of it as a carrot, rather than a stick.  It’s not a guaranteed solution, though. Some researchers might still prioritize speed and familiar methods even with incentives.  The effectiveness depends on the size and nature of the reward, and how it's communicated.

Sarah:  So it's not a silver bullet, but a helpful tool in a larger strategy?

Joe:  Precisely. It's one piece of the puzzle.  You need a combination of things: improved antibody production methods, robust validation processes, readily available resources for validation, and, importantly, a change in the scientific culture to prioritize reliability over speed and familiarity.  It's a system-wide problem, and a system-wide solution is needed.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves, but the entire research workflow and the incentives surrounding it.

Sarah:  So, it's a continuously evolving system, as you mentioned earlier.  It sounds like a long-term project.

Joe:  Absolutely.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  But the progress reported in the article is encouraging.  The increased adoption of recombinant antibodies, the collaborative efforts of organizations like OGA, and the growing awareness of the issue among researchers all point towards a more reliable future for antibody-based research.  There’s still a long way to go, but there is progress.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

**Sarah:** So, Joe, you were just outlining the ways researchers validate their antibodies.  That sounded… complicated.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation…  It’s a lot to take in. Can you break it down a bit more simply for our listeners?

**Joe:**  Sure, Sarah.  Let's start with the basics.  The goal is always the same:  to make sure the antibody actually binds to the specific protein we think it should, and nothing else.  We need to be certain it's not cross-reacting, you know, sticking to other proteins by mistake.

**Sarah:** Right, so it's like making sure your key only fits the right lock, not any other lock on the keyring?

**Joe:**  That's... not a bad analogy, actually.  But think of it more like this: we're trying to identify a specific molecule within a complex mixture.  Each technique offers a different way to do that. Immunohistochemistry, for example, is like looking at a tissue sample under a microscope.  If the antibody binds to the protein, those cells light up, essentially.  It gives a visual confirmation of where the protein is located within the tissue.

**Sarah:** Okay, so that's a visual check. What about the others?

**Joe:**  Western blotting is different.  It separates proteins by size, like sorting marbles by size.  Then, we add our antibody. If it binds to the protein of the expected size, we see a band on the blot, confirming the antibody's specificity.

**Sarah:** So, a size-based confirmation.  And immunoprecipitation?

**Joe:** That's more like fishing. We use the antibody as bait, attached to tiny beads.  These beads grab the target protein out of a complex sample.  Then, we can analyze what we've caught using something called mass spectrometry, which identifies the protein's precise makeup. It’s a very powerful technique for confirmation.

**Sarah:**  So, each method offers a different kind of confirmation,  providing a more complete picture of the antibody's reliability.  It sounds like a lot of work! No wonder there's been so much emphasis on improving the process.

**Joe:**  Absolutely.  And it's not always straightforward.  Sometimes you get unexpected results, and you have to troubleshoot, repeat experiments, and refine your approach. It's a process of iterative refinement.

**Sarah:**  So, it's not just a case of "one and done"?

**Joe:**  Definitely not.  It's a rigorous process, and that's crucial for reliable scientific findings.  You really need to be confident in your reagents – which includes antibodies –  before you build any conclusions on top of them.

**Sarah:** That's incredibly important to remember.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. It makes the research process seem much more nuanced and challenging than I initially thought.


**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it today.

**Sarah:** Absolutely.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly valuable.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  Is that directly linked to unreliable antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Um, yeah, it's a significant contributor.  You see, scientists rely heavily on antibodies to, you know, identify and quantify specific proteins within cells.  Think of them as highly specific molecular tags.  But, and this is a big but, many commercially available antibodies just don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein strongly enough, or worse, they bind to other proteins entirely, giving you completely false results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, false positives, basically?  That's... concerning. I mean, how many studies could be affected by this?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's incredibly concerning.  One study highlighted the case of a single antibody used in over fifteen papers, cited over 3000 times! And guess what?  That antibody didn't even bind to the intended protein.  It was completely useless for the purpose it was used in those papers.  Think of the wasted time, resources, and the potential for misleading conclusions... it's a huge problem.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow. That's... a shocking number.  So, what's being done to address this?  Is it just a matter of better quality control from the antibody manufacturers?
[INFO] Joe: It's a multifaceted problem, so the solutions are multifaceted too.  Yes, better quality control from manufacturers is crucial. But it's not just that.  There's a growing movement towards open science initiatives, like iCharOS – that's pronounced "Icarus" –  which aims to systematically test and characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein.  It’s a massive undertaking.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds like a Herculean task!  But incredibly important. So, are researchers just blindly trusting the manufacturers' claims now, or are there ways to verify the antibodies independently?
[INFO] Joe: Ah, that's a great question.  Ideally, researchers should always independently validate the antibodies they use.  But, um, that's often not done, or it's not done rigorously enough.  Part of the problem is the lack of readily available, well-characterized antibodies.  iCharOS and similar initiatives are trying to change that by providing a public database of validated antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a combination of better manufacturing, better testing, and increased transparency and collaboration?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly! It’s a systems problem that needs a systems solution.  It requires better standards, more rigorous testing, and a shift in the research culture towards greater scrutiny and sharing of data.  It’s a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like iCharOS are paving the way for more reliable research and, ultimately, faster progress in biomedical science.
[INFO] Sarah: It's certainly a crucial step.  Thanks for explaining this, Joe.  It's much clearer now why this antibody issue is such a big deal.  It really highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and open science.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, you mentioned the YCharOS initiative and its impact on antibody validation.  It's a really significant effort, you know?  Their approach of comparing antibody performance in cell lines with and without the target protein – that's crucial for establishing specificity.  It directly addresses the problem of false positives, which, as we discussed earlier, can completely derail research.
[INFO] Sarah: Right.  But it makes me wonder,  how scalable is this method?  I mean, they've tested over a thousand antibodies, which is impressive, but there are millions on the market.  Is this kind of rigorous testing feasible for every single antibody?  And what about antibodies targeting less-studied proteins?  Would the availability of appropriate cell lines be a limiting factor?
[INFO] Joe: That's a great point.  Scalability is definitely a challenge.  The process is labor-intensive, requiring careful cell culture, meticulous experimental design, and robust data analysis.  For less-studied proteins, finding suitable cell lines could indeed be difficult, potentially requiring the generation of new cell lines specifically for validation purposes. This adds another layer of complexity and cost.  And of course, the sheer number of antibodies is overwhelming.  It's not a simple matter of just scaling up the current process linearly.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what other approaches are there, then?  You mentioned OMAPs, which seems to tackle the problem from a different angle.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within specific applications, across different contexts.  Instead of aiming for universal validation, they concentrate on confirming performance within a defined set of experimental conditions – say, in various tissue types using a particular imaging technique. This is a more targeted approach, potentially more feasible for a larger scale, but it doesn't guarantee performance across the board.  It's a trade-off.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's like, YCharOS is aiming for broader, more fundamental validation, while OMAPs is more focused on application-specific validation?  Is that a fair summary?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, pretty much.  YCharOS provides a strong foundation, showing whether the antibody binds to its intended target under controlled conditions.  OMAPs then builds upon that, validating performance in real-world applications.  Ideally, you'd want both types of validation, but it’s a resource-intensive endeavor.
[INFO] Sarah: It's fascinating how these two approaches complement each other, almost like two sides of the same coin.  It really highlights the complexity of this issue and the need for multiple strategies to tackle it.  It sounds like a collaborative effort involving researchers, manufacturers, and funding agencies is absolutely crucial.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  This isn't something any single group can solve on their own.  The scale of the problem demands a collaborative, multi-faceted approach.  And transparent data sharing, as YCharOS does, is critical to building trust and accelerating progress.  It's a bit of a messy problem, but the progress is encouraging.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, Joe, so we've talked about the challenges of antibody reliability in research.  You mentioned these RRIDs – Research Resource Identifiers –  to help track down antibodies. Can you explain that a bit more simply?  It sounds a bit… technical.
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  Think of it like this: every antibody, ideally, should have a unique ID number, like a barcode, that never changes.  Right now, companies often use their own catalog numbers, which can disappear if the company stops making that antibody, or even be duplicated by accident.  RRIDs are designed to be a permanent, universally recognized identifier for each antibody, regardless of the supplier. So, if someone publishes a paper using a specific antibody with its RRID, anyone else can easily find that exact same antibody years later, even if the original supplier is gone.  It's about creating a permanent record, you know?
[INFO] Sarah: So, it’s basically a standardized, persistent identifier to solve the problem of disappearing or duplicated catalog numbers.  That makes sense. But it sounds like even with RRIDs, identifying *good* antibodies is still a huge hurdle.  You mentioned CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies. How does that fit into the picture?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  RRIDs help you *find* the antibody, but CiteAb helps you assess its quality. It's a database that compiles information on many antibodies, including citation counts.  The more a particular antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable. They're also starting to integrate data from YCharOS, which adds another layer of validation –  characterization data, showing exactly how the antibody performs.  It's not foolproof, of course.  But it provides researchers with much more information than they’ve had in the past to make informed decisions.
[INFO] Sarah: So, more data means better decisions.  But you also mentioned something about "knock-out validation." What's that?
[INFO] Joe: Knock-out validation is a very rigorous way to check if an antibody is truly specific to its target.  Basically, you genetically modify cells to remove (knock out) the protein the antibody is supposed to detect.  If the antibody no longer binds to these modified cells, it confirms that it's specifically recognizing the target protein and not something else.  It's a gold standard, but unfortunately, very few antibodies have undergone this kind of validation.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds incredibly thorough, but also, as you said, quite rare.  So, even with all these tools – RRIDs, CiteAb, and knock-out validation – we’re still far from a perfect solution, right?
[INFO] Joe: Um, yeah.  It's a complex problem with no single, easy fix.  The good news is that there's a growing awareness of the issue and initiatives, like the Only Good Antibodies community, are bringing together stakeholders to work on solutions collaboratively.  It’s a messy, ongoing process, but progress is being made.  It's a bit like… well, maybe not like a puzzle, because that implies a neat solution.  It's more like…  a continuously evolving system needing constant refinement.
[INFO] Sarah: I think that’s a good way to put it.  A continuously evolving system.  It makes it clear that this isn’t a problem that will be solved overnight. Thanks, Joe, for explaining all that.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so we’ve talked about the challenges with antibody reliability, and the move towards recombinant antibodies seems like a big part of the solution.  But, you know, the article mentions that changing scientist behavior is still a huge hurdle.  Can you explain why that is so difficult, Joe?
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's a complex issue.  It boils down to a few things. First, there's inertia.  Scientists, like anyone else, often stick with what they know and what works, even if it's not ideal.  If an antibody has yielded results in the past, there's a reluctance to switch, even if there's evidence suggesting it might not be perfectly specific or reliable.  It takes time and effort to validate a new antibody, and researchers are often under pressure to publish, so they might prioritize speed over rigorous validation.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's a time and resource issue, right?  They're juggling deadlines and funding…
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  And then there's the issue of trust.  Some scientists might be hesitant to trust new antibodies, especially if they've had bad experiences with unreliable ones in the past.  Building trust in the new recombinant antibodies and the validation processes is crucial.  It's not just about the technology; it's about changing a culture of reliance on established, even if imperfect, methods.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes sense.  It sounds like a classic case of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality, even if it’s subtly broken.  But the article also talks about rewards for using best practices.  How effective do you think that approach is?
[INFO] Joe: Well, incentives can definitely help. Offering grants or other forms of recognition for adopting best practices can encourage scientists to invest the time and resources needed for validation.  Think of it as a carrot, rather than a stick.  It’s not a guaranteed solution, though. Some researchers might still prioritize speed and familiar methods even with incentives.  The effectiveness depends on the size and nature of the reward, and how it's communicated.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's not a silver bullet, but a helpful tool in a larger strategy?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely. It's one piece of the puzzle.  You need a combination of things: improved antibody production methods, robust validation processes, readily available resources for validation, and, importantly, a change in the scientific culture to prioritize reliability over speed and familiarity.  It's a system-wide problem, and a system-wide solution is needed.  It's not just about the antibodies themselves, but the entire research workflow and the incentives surrounding it.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's a continuously evolving system, as you mentioned earlier.  It sounds like a long-term project.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  But the progress reported in the article is encouraging.  The increased adoption of recombinant antibodies, the collaborative efforts of organizations like OGA, and the growing awareness of the issue among researchers all point towards a more reliable future for antibody-based research.  There’s still a long way to go, but there is progress.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, Joe, you were just outlining the ways researchers validate their antibodies.  That sounded… complicated.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation…  It’s a lot to take in. Can you break it down a bit more simply for our listeners?
[INFO] Joe: **  Sure, Sarah.  Let's start with the basics.  The goal is always the same:  to make sure the antibody actually binds to the specific protein we think it should, and nothing else.  We need to be certain it's not cross-reacting, you know, sticking to other proteins by mistake.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Right, so it's like making sure your key only fits the right lock, not any other lock on the keyring?
[INFO] Joe: **  That's... not a bad analogy, actually.  But think of it more like this: we're trying to identify a specific molecule within a complex mixture.  Each technique offers a different way to do that. Immunohistochemistry, for example, is like looking at a tissue sample under a microscope.  If the antibody binds to the protein, those cells light up, essentially.  It gives a visual confirmation of where the protein is located within the tissue.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Okay, so that's a visual check. What about the others?
[INFO] Joe: **  Western blotting is different.  It separates proteins by size, like sorting marbles by size.  Then, we add our antibody. If it binds to the protein of the expected size, we see a band on the blot, confirming the antibody's specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: ** So, a size-based confirmation.  And immunoprecipitation?
[INFO] Joe: ** That's more like fishing. We use the antibody as bait, attached to tiny beads.  These beads grab the target protein out of a complex sample.  Then, we can analyze what we've caught using something called mass spectrometry, which identifies the protein's precise makeup. It’s a very powerful technique for confirmation.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, each method offers a different kind of confirmation,  providing a more complete picture of the antibody's reliability.  It sounds like a lot of work! No wonder there's been so much emphasis on improving the process.
[INFO] Joe: **  Absolutely.  And it's not always straightforward.  Sometimes you get unexpected results, and you have to troubleshoot, repeat experiments, and refine your approach. It's a process of iterative refinement.
[INFO] Sarah: **  So, it's not just a case of "one and done"?
[INFO] Joe: **  Definitely not.  It's a rigorous process, and that's crucial for reliable scientific findings.  You really need to be confident in your reagents – which includes antibodies –  before you build any conclusions on top of them.
[INFO] Sarah: ** That's incredibly important to remember.  Thanks for clarifying that, Joe. It makes the research process seem much more nuanced and challenging than I initially thought.
[INFO] Joe: ** My pleasure, Sarah.  It's a complex field, but hopefully, we've shed some light on it today.
[INFO] Sarah: ** Absolutely.  I think our listeners will find this incredibly valuable.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a bit frustrating—problem in biomedical research: unreliable antibodies.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  It's like, you read a study, you try to replicate it, and…nothing.  Is it really all down to antibodies?

Joe:  Um, well, not *all* of it, but a significant chunk, yeah.  It's a huge issue.  Take this study by Carl Laflamme. He was studying this protein, encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, linked to motor neuron disease.  The problem?  He couldn't find consistent information on where this protein even *was* in the cell.  Different papers pointed to different locations.

Sarah:  Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, what was the root of the problem?

Joe:  He suspected the antibodies.  You know, scientists use antibodies to, uh, essentially tag and track proteins within cells.  They need to be very specific—bind only to the target protein, and nothing else.  Laflamme tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly.

Sarah: Only three out of sixteen? That's... a shockingly low success rate.

Joe:  Yeah, it's alarming.  And get this –  he found that about fifteen papers had used an antibody that *didn't even bind* to the right protein!  These papers had been cited thousands of times.  That's a huge impact on the field.  It highlights a massive reproducibility problem.  It's not just Laflamme's experience, either.  This is a widespread issue.  Many commercial antibodies just don't perform as advertised.

Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this? Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies producing these antibodies?

Joe:  It's a multifaceted problem needing a multifaceted solution. Yes, better quality control from vendors is crucial. But there are also initiatives like iCharOS – that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science –  aimed at systematically characterizing every human protein antibody.  They're trying to create a comprehensive database of reliable antibodies.  There are other efforts focusing on improving antibody production techniques and promoting best practices among researchers. It's a huge collaborative effort involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.

Sarah:  So, it’s not just about the companies, but also about how researchers use these antibodies and how the research is communicated and validated?  It sounds like a systemic problem.

Joe: Exactly.  It's a systemic problem requiring a collaborative, systemic solution.  It's a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like iCharOS and others will make a real difference and increase the reliability of research findings.  It's all about building trust and improving the overall quality of biomedical research.  It's a pretty important area to get right, given the impact on drug development and patient care.

Sarah: Absolutely.  This has been really illuminating, Joe. Thanks for explaining this complex issue so clearly.  It's amazing how something seemingly so small as an antibody can have such a huge ripple effect on the entire field.

Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we delve into…

My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we delve into…

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe: So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody validation efforts, particularly YCharOS.  It really highlights a significant problem in research, right? The sheer scale of commercially available antibodies, and the surprisingly high failure rate.

Sarah:  Exactly!  Millions of antibodies, and a huge chunk just don't perform as advertised.  It's mind-boggling.  What I found particularly interesting about YCharOS is their approach – comparing antibody specificity in a cell line expressing the target protein versus a knockout line lacking it. Can you break that down for us in simple terms?  I mean, for someone like me, who’s not a biochemist…

Joe:  Sure.  So, they're basically checking if the antibody only binds to the intended protein.  The cell line with the protein – that’s your positive control.  If the antibody binds there, that's expected.  But the knockout line, lacking the protein, is crucial.  If the antibody *still* binds in the knockout, that means it's binding to something else, not being specific to the target.  That's a false positive, and indicates a problem with the antibody's specificity.  It's a very straightforward test, but immensely powerful in identifying unreliable antibodies.

Sarah:  That makes sense.  So, it's a way of checking for cross-reactivity, right?  Like, is it binding to something *else* besides the intended target?

Joe:  Precisely.  Cross-reactivity is a major source of problems.  It leads to false results in experiments. And you know, it's not just about specificity; there's also the question of sensitivity – how well the antibody detects the target protein even at low concentrations.  YCharOS’s method focuses primarily on specificity, but the sensitivity is implied if it works well in the positive control.  It's not a complete picture, but it's a substantial improvement over what we had before.


Sarah:  Right. So, YCharOS is focusing on one aspect – specificity in a specific context.  But then you have OMAPs, which takes a different approach, focusing on one application, but across many contexts…  It seems like there's no single perfect solution.

Joe: Um, yeah. OMAPs is more about validating antibodies for a specific application, like multiplex imaging, but across different tissue types and methods.  It’s a complementary approach.  You need both kinds of validation, really.  YCharOS gives you a baseline of specificity, and OMAPs checks how that specificity holds up in different real-world scenarios. It’s a bit like… well, maybe not an analogy, but think of it this way: YCharOS is like a rigorous lab test, while OMAPs is like field testing the product.

Sarah:  Okay, that actually helps visualize it. So, it's not about one being better than the other, but rather they address different aspects of antibody reliability?

Joe: Exactly.  They're both crucial.  And you know, the scale of the problem is enormous.  We’re talking millions of antibodies, and many, many researchers relying on these tools.  These validation efforts are vital for the integrity of scientific research.  It’s a huge undertaking, but incredibly important.

Sarah:  Absolutely. It's a testament to the collaborative spirit of the scientific community that initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs are even possible.  It's a problem that needs a community-wide solution, and it seems like we're starting to see that happen.

Joe:  Definitely.  And it highlights the importance of rigorous validation and transparency in scientific research.  This is a huge step forward.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, this article really highlights the messiness of antibody research, right?  It seems like a huge problem, this lack of consistent labeling and validation.  Ninety percent of antibodies lacking catalogue numbers… that's staggering.

Joe: Yeah, it's pretty shocking.  Um, the article points out that  researchers were struggling to even *find* the specific antibodies used in previous studies because of inconsistent labeling.  The lack of a standardized, persistent identifier, like these RRIDs, made it almost impossible to track down the exact reagent.  Think of it like trying to find a specific book in a library without a Dewey Decimal number – incredibly difficult, if not impossible.

Sarah:  Right, I get that. So these RRIDs are essentially unique IDs for each antibody?  Like a universal product code, but for science?

Joe:  Exactly. They're meant to be persistent, even if a company stops producing the antibody or changes its catalogue number.  That's the key improvement over relying on company-specific codes which can disappear.  It's a crucial first step towards reproducibility.

Sarah:  But even with RRIDs, it seems like the problem goes deeper than just labeling, right? The article mentions CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies.  Even with that, finding *good* antibodies is still a challenge.

Joe:  Absolutely.  CiteAb helps with finding highly cited antibodies, which *suggests* reliability, but it's not a guarantee of quality.  Many antibodies are used in various ways, across different species.  There's no simple "good" or "bad" label you can just slap on.  The article mentions knockout validation as a gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have that level of validation.  That's a huge gap.

Sarah:  So, what *is* knockout validation?  I feel like that's a key term here that needs a bit more explanation.

Joe:  Okay, so knockout validation essentially involves genetically modifying an organism to remove the target protein the antibody is supposed to detect. If the antibody no longer detects anything in the knockout organism, it confirms that the antibody is specifically targeting the intended protein, and not something else.  It's a rigorous way to verify specificity.

Sarah:  That makes sense.  So it's a more robust way of verifying the antibody's accuracy than just looking at citations.  And it sounds like that's where the real problem lies – the lack of rigorous validation across the board.

Joe:  Precisely.  The article mentions the Only Good Antibodies community, OGA, which is trying to bring together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers to address these issues.  It's a collaborative effort to improve standards and promote better practices.  It's a complicated problem that requires a multi-faceted approach.

Sarah:  It certainly sounds like it. It's frustrating to think about all the research that could be flawed because of unreliable antibodies.  It makes you question the validity of so much published work, doesn't it?

Joe:  It definitely does.  And that's why initiatives like RRIDs and OGA are so important. They are attempting to address a systematic problem that impacts the entire scientific community.  It's a long road, but it's a necessary one.

It definitely does.  And that's why initiatives like RRIDs and OGA are so important. They are attempting to address a systematic problem that impacts the entire scientific community.  It's a long road, but it's a necessary one.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Joe: So, Sarah, we were talking about the challenges with antibody reproducibility, and how initiatives like OGA are trying to tackle this.  It's a huge undertaking, you know?  The core issue is... well, it boils down to the variability in antibody production methods.  Older methods, using immune cells or hybridomas, lead to batches that aren't identical.  Think of it like baking a cake –  if you don't follow the recipe exactly, you'll get slightly different results each time.

Sarah:  Right, so the inconsistencies are a big problem.  But you mentioned recombinant antibodies as a solution. Can you explain that a bit more?  I understand it's a different production method, but what's the technical difference that makes them more reproducible?

Joe:  Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells. These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence.  There's no variation introduced by the immune system's natural processes.  It's a much more controlled and standardized process.  It's like having a precise, automated cake-making machine instead of relying on a human baker. That's a pretty good analogy, actually.

Sarah:  Okay, that makes sense. So, it's a more controlled, predictable process.  But even with recombinant antibodies, aren't there still challenges?  The article mentioned that researchers sometimes ignore validation results if they're happy with their results.

Joe:  You're absolutely right.  That's a huge hurdle.  Even with better, more consistent antibodies, researchers still need to validate their results independently, to ensure the antibody is actually binding to the target it's supposed to. It's not always easy to convince someone to redo their experiments, especially if they've already invested significant time and resources.  There's a human element here that's hard to overcome.

Sarah:  So, it's not just a technical problem, it's also a behavioral one.  The article mentioned that about 20% of papers from 2023 using antibodies used recombinants. That's a significant increase, but it also means that a large portion still aren't.  Is that number surprising to you?

Joe: Hmm,  twenty percent...  it's a step in the right direction, but it also highlights the slow pace of adoption.  It takes time for new methods to be widely accepted, and there are inertia and resistance to change, especially in established research practices.  It's not a quick fix.  Also, there might be practical limitations for some researchers to switch to recombinant antibodies, cost for instance.


Sarah:  So, even with technological improvements and initiatives like OGA, changing researcher behavior is a major obstacle.  It sounds frustrating!

Joe:  It is,  but it's also a really important area of focus.  The initiatives we discussed are trying to address this through community building, incentives, and improved information sharing.  It's a multifaceted problem requiring a multifaceted approach.  It's a long game, you know?  But progress is being made.


Sarah:  It's definitely a marathon, not a sprint.  Thanks, Joe, for clarifying all that. It's a complex issue, but I think we've shed some light on it.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 -------RESPONSE FROM VERTEX AI---------
 (Sound of a gentle microphone adjustment)

Sarah:  So, Joe, we’ve talked about the challenges of antibody validation.  It sounds...intense.  You mentioned immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation.  Can you maybe just…walk me through those again, but, you know, a little slower this time?  I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all.

Joe:  Sure thing, Sarah.  Let’s start with immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you’re taking a sample of cells, right? And you're applying your antibody to see if it binds to a specific protein within those cells.  If the antibody binds, it indicates the presence of that protein.  It's like...a visual confirmation.  Think of it as highlighting the protein of interest within the cell sample.  It's quite a visual method.

Sarah:  Okay, so it’s a direct observation method.  Like, you can actually *see* if the antibody is working?

Joe:  Exactly.  You use a microscope to see if the antibody has bound to the protein in the cells. It's a pretty straightforward way to get a quick visual confirmation. Now, Western blotting is different.  This one's more about confirming the *size* of the protein the antibody binds to. We separate proteins by size using a gel, and then we use the antibody to detect the protein of interest.  If we see a band at the expected size, it suggests we've got the right protein.

Sarah:  So, immunohistochemistry shows *where* the protein is, and Western blotting shows *how big* it is.  Is that right?

Joe:  Yeah, pretty much.  And then immunoprecipitation… that's a bit more complex.  Here, we use the antibody to physically pull out the protein from a complex mixture of proteins. We use beads coated with the antibody, which act like tiny magnets, grabbing the protein we want.  Then, we can analyze the captured protein using mass spectrometry to confirm its identity.  It’s a more rigorous method, offering a more definitive identification.

Sarah:  So, you’re using three different techniques to essentially verify that your antibody is actually targeting the correct protein, and each one gives you a slightly different piece of information.  That makes sense...somewhat.  It still feels like a lot of work to validate something so crucial, though.  It's not just a simple "yes" or "no," is it?


Joe:  No, absolutely not.  It’s a rigorous process designed to minimize errors and ensure reliability. And, truthfully, sometimes even with all these methods, there can still be some uncertainty.  That's why it's a marathon, not a sprint, right?  It’s all about building confidence in your results.

Sarah:  Right.  Well, Joe, this has been incredibly helpful. I think I have a much better understanding of antibody validation now.  Thank you for breaking it down so clearly.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It’s important to understand these processes, especially given their crucial role in research.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating—and frankly, a bit frustrating—problem in biomedical research: unreliable antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  The reproducibility crisis, right?  It's like, you read a study, you try to replicate it, and…nothing.  Is it really all down to antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: Um, well, not *all* of it, but a significant chunk, yeah.  It's a huge issue.  Take this study by Carl Laflamme. He was studying this protein, encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, linked to motor neuron disease.  The problem?  He couldn't find consistent information on where this protein even *was* in the cell.  Different papers pointed to different locations.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating.  So, what was the root of the problem?
[INFO] Joe: He suspected the antibodies.  You know, scientists use antibodies to, uh, essentially tag and track proteins within cells.  They need to be very specific—bind only to the target protein, and nothing else.  Laflamme tested sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this C9ORF72 protein.  Only three actually worked properly.
[INFO] Sarah: Only three out of sixteen? That's... a shockingly low success rate.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's alarming.  And get this –  he found that about fifteen papers had used an antibody that *didn't even bind* to the right protein!  These papers had been cited thousands of times.  That's a huge impact on the field.  It highlights a massive reproducibility problem.  It's not just Laflamme's experience, either.  This is a widespread issue.  Many commercial antibodies just don't perform as advertised.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this? Is it just a matter of better quality control from the companies producing these antibodies?
[INFO] Joe: It's a multifaceted problem needing a multifaceted solution. Yes, better quality control from vendors is crucial. But there are also initiatives like iCharOS – that's Antibody Characterization through Open Science –  aimed at systematically characterizing every human protein antibody.  They're trying to create a comprehensive database of reliable antibodies.  There are other efforts focusing on improving antibody production techniques and promoting best practices among researchers. It's a huge collaborative effort involving vendors, funding agencies, and publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it’s not just about the companies, but also about how researchers use these antibodies and how the research is communicated and validated?  It sounds like a systemic problem.
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  It's a systemic problem requiring a collaborative, systemic solution.  It's a long road, but hopefully, initiatives like iCharOS and others will make a real difference and increase the reliability of research findings.  It's all about building trust and improving the overall quality of biomedical research.  It's a pretty important area to get right, given the impact on drug development and patient care.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely.  This has been really illuminating, Joe. Thanks for explaining this complex issue so clearly.  It's amazing how something seemingly so small as an antibody can have such a huge ripple effect on the entire field.
[INFO] Joe: My pleasure, Sarah.  And that's all the time we have for today's episode of Science Odyssey.  Join us next time as we delve into…
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, that was a fascinating look at the antibody validation efforts, particularly YCharOS.  It really highlights a significant problem in research, right? The sheer scale of commercially available antibodies, and the surprisingly high failure rate.
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly!  Millions of antibodies, and a huge chunk just don't perform as advertised.  It's mind-boggling.  What I found particularly interesting about YCharOS is their approach – comparing antibody specificity in a cell line expressing the target protein versus a knockout line lacking it. Can you break that down for us in simple terms?  I mean, for someone like me, who’s not a biochemist…
[INFO] Joe: Sure.  So, they're basically checking if the antibody only binds to the intended protein.  The cell line with the protein – that’s your positive control.  If the antibody binds there, that's expected.  But the knockout line, lacking the protein, is crucial.  If the antibody *still* binds in the knockout, that means it's binding to something else, not being specific to the target.  That's a false positive, and indicates a problem with the antibody's specificity.  It's a very straightforward test, but immensely powerful in identifying unreliable antibodies.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes sense.  So, it's a way of checking for cross-reactivity, right?  Like, is it binding to something *else* besides the intended target?
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  Cross-reactivity is a major source of problems.  It leads to false results in experiments. And you know, it's not just about specificity; there's also the question of sensitivity – how well the antibody detects the target protein even at low concentrations.  YCharOS’s method focuses primarily on specificity, but the sensitivity is implied if it works well in the positive control.  It's not a complete picture, but it's a substantial improvement over what we had before.
[INFO] Sarah: Right. So, YCharOS is focusing on one aspect – specificity in a specific context.  But then you have OMAPs, which takes a different approach, focusing on one application, but across many contexts…  It seems like there's no single perfect solution.
[INFO] Joe: Um, yeah. OMAPs is more about validating antibodies for a specific application, like multiplex imaging, but across different tissue types and methods.  It’s a complementary approach.  You need both kinds of validation, really.  YCharOS gives you a baseline of specificity, and OMAPs checks how that specificity holds up in different real-world scenarios. It’s a bit like… well, maybe not an analogy, but think of it this way: YCharOS is like a rigorous lab test, while OMAPs is like field testing the product.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that actually helps visualize it. So, it's not about one being better than the other, but rather they address different aspects of antibody reliability?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  They're both crucial.  And you know, the scale of the problem is enormous.  We’re talking millions of antibodies, and many, many researchers relying on these tools.  These validation efforts are vital for the integrity of scientific research.  It’s a huge undertaking, but incredibly important.
[INFO] Sarah: Absolutely. It's a testament to the collaborative spirit of the scientific community that initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs are even possible.  It's a problem that needs a community-wide solution, and it seems like we're starting to see that happen.
[INFO] Joe: Definitely.  And it highlights the importance of rigorous validation and transparency in scientific research.  This is a huge step forward.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, this article really highlights the messiness of antibody research, right?  It seems like a huge problem, this lack of consistent labeling and validation.  Ninety percent of antibodies lacking catalogue numbers… that's staggering.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, it's pretty shocking.  Um, the article points out that  researchers were struggling to even *find* the specific antibodies used in previous studies because of inconsistent labeling.  The lack of a standardized, persistent identifier, like these RRIDs, made it almost impossible to track down the exact reagent.  Think of it like trying to find a specific book in a library without a Dewey Decimal number – incredibly difficult, if not impossible.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, I get that. So these RRIDs are essentially unique IDs for each antibody?  Like a universal product code, but for science?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly. They're meant to be persistent, even if a company stops producing the antibody or changes its catalogue number.  That's the key improvement over relying on company-specific codes which can disappear.  It's a crucial first step towards reproducibility.
[INFO] Sarah: But even with RRIDs, it seems like the problem goes deeper than just labeling, right? The article mentions CiteAb, a search engine for antibodies.  Even with that, finding *good* antibodies is still a challenge.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  CiteAb helps with finding highly cited antibodies, which *suggests* reliability, but it's not a guarantee of quality.  Many antibodies are used in various ways, across different species.  There's no simple "good" or "bad" label you can just slap on.  The article mentions knockout validation as a gold standard, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have that level of validation.  That's a huge gap.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what *is* knockout validation?  I feel like that's a key term here that needs a bit more explanation.
[INFO] Joe: Okay, so knockout validation essentially involves genetically modifying an organism to remove the target protein the antibody is supposed to detect. If the antibody no longer detects anything in the knockout organism, it confirms that the antibody is specifically targeting the intended protein, and not something else.  It's a rigorous way to verify specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes sense.  So it's a more robust way of verifying the antibody's accuracy than just looking at citations.  And it sounds like that's where the real problem lies – the lack of rigorous validation across the board.
[INFO] Joe: Precisely.  The article mentions the Only Good Antibodies community, OGA, which is trying to bring together researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, and publishers to address these issues.  It's a collaborative effort to improve standards and promote better practices.  It's a complicated problem that requires a multi-faceted approach.
[INFO] Sarah: It certainly sounds like it. It's frustrating to think about all the research that could be flawed because of unreliable antibodies.  It makes you question the validity of so much published work, doesn't it?
[INFO] Joe: It definitely does.  And that's why initiatives like RRIDs and OGA are so important. They are attempting to address a systematic problem that impacts the entire scientific community.  It's a long road, but it's a necessary one.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, we were talking about the challenges with antibody reproducibility, and how initiatives like OGA are trying to tackle this.  It's a huge undertaking, you know?  The core issue is... well, it boils down to the variability in antibody production methods.  Older methods, using immune cells or hybridomas, lead to batches that aren't identical.  Think of it like baking a cake –  if you don't follow the recipe exactly, you'll get slightly different results each time.
[INFO] Sarah: Right, so the inconsistencies are a big problem.  But you mentioned recombinant antibodies as a solution. Can you explain that a bit more?  I understand it's a different production method, but what's the technical difference that makes them more reproducible?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells. These cells are programmed to produce *only* a specific antibody sequence.  There's no variation introduced by the immune system's natural processes.  It's a much more controlled and standardized process.  It's like having a precise, automated cake-making machine instead of relying on a human baker. That's a pretty good analogy, actually.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, it's a more controlled, predictable process.  But even with recombinant antibodies, aren't there still challenges?  The article mentioned that researchers sometimes ignore validation results if they're happy with their results.
[INFO] Joe: You're absolutely right.  That's a huge hurdle.  Even with better, more consistent antibodies, researchers still need to validate their results independently, to ensure the antibody is actually binding to the target it's supposed to. It's not always easy to convince someone to redo their experiments, especially if they've already invested significant time and resources.  There's a human element here that's hard to overcome.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not just a technical problem, it's also a behavioral one.  The article mentioned that about 20% of papers from 2023 using antibodies used recombinants. That's a significant increase, but it also means that a large portion still aren't.  Is that number surprising to you?
[INFO] Joe: Hmm,  twenty percent...  it's a step in the right direction, but it also highlights the slow pace of adoption.  It takes time for new methods to be widely accepted, and there are inertia and resistance to change, especially in established research practices.  It's not a quick fix.  Also, there might be practical limitations for some researchers to switch to recombinant antibodies, cost for instance.
[INFO] Sarah: So, even with technological improvements and initiatives like OGA, changing researcher behavior is a major obstacle.  It sounds frustrating!
[INFO] Joe: It is,  but it's also a really important area of focus.  The initiatives we discussed are trying to address this through community building, incentives, and improved information sharing.  It's a multifaceted problem requiring a multifaceted approach.  It's a long game, you know?  But progress is being made.
[INFO] Sarah: It's definitely a marathon, not a sprint.  Thanks, Joe, for clarifying all that. It's a complex issue, but I think we've shed some light on it.

Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

 Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.

Sarah:  Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  It sounds like a pretty big problem, right?  I mean, if the tools scientists use aren't reliable, how can we trust the results?

Joe: Exactly!  Um, the issue is huge.  Take, for example, the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein, you know, encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, linked to motor neuron disease.  He needed antibodies to identify and track this protein within cells.  But,  and this is the kicker,  the literature was a mess.  Different papers reported wildly different locations for this protein within the cell.  Total chaos.

Sarah:  Wow, so conflicting results.  That doesn't sound good at all.  What was the reason for this discrepancy?

Joe:  Well, Laflamme suspected the antibodies themselves.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies advertised as binding to this specific protein.  Only three actually worked reliably – meaning they bound to the *right* protein and nothing else.  The rest?  A complete waste of time and resources.  And get this, some of the poorly performing antibodies had been used in studies cited thousands of times!

Sarah:  Thousands of times?! That's astonishing. So,  a lot of published research might be based on unreliable data?

Joe:  Potentially, yes.  It highlights a massive reproducibility problem in biological sciences.  It's not just Laflamme's experience either.  Many scientists have faced this issue.  Many commercial antibodies simply don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein specifically, or they might bind to other molecules, leading to false results.

Sarah:  So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there some sort of quality control initiative?

Joe:  Absolutely.  There are several initiatives underway.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  This project aims to comprehensively characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein. It's a huge undertaking, but it's a step in the right direction.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and to encourage better practices within the scientific community – how researchers select and use these antibodies.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and even scientific publishers.

Sarah:  That sounds promising.  It seems like such a fundamental problem, though.  If the very tools of the trade are unreliable, it must significantly impact the pace of scientific discovery.

Joe:  You're absolutely right.  It's been a huge bottleneck.  It wastes time, money, and resources.  It also undermines confidence in research findings.  But hopefully, with initiatives like iCharOS and a greater awareness of the problem, we can start to improve the situation.  It's a long road, but the hope is that this will lead to more reliable research and faster progress in biomedical sciences.

Sarah:  Definitely.  This has been eye-opening, Joe. Thanks for shedding light on this critical issue.  I think our listeners will find this equally fascinating and concerning.

Sarah: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

 Joe:  So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody crisis.  The sheer scale of it is, um, staggering.  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a significant portion—we're talking upwards of two-thirds in some studies—simply don't perform as advertised.  It's a massive problem for research reproducibility, you know?

Sarah:  Exactly.  It's mind-boggling.  And what's even more concerning is that this isn't some niche issue; it affects almost every area of biological research.  This YCharOS initiative, though, seems like a really promising step forward.  But can you explain, in simple terms, how their testing methodology actually works?  They mentioned something about knockout cell lines...

Joe:  Right. So, YCharOS uses a comparative approach.  They test the antibody's performance in two different cell lines. One cell line *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is *supposed* to bind to – at normal levels. The other cell line is a "knockout" line; it's genetically modified to *lack* that specific protein.  The idea is straightforward: if the antibody is truly specific, it should only bind strongly to the cells containing the target protein and show minimal binding, or no binding at all, in the knockout cells.  That's the key to determining specificity.

Sarah:  Okay, I think I get that. So, it's a control experiment, essentially.  A very important one, it seems.  But what about selectivity?  Is that tested in a similar way?

Joe:  Well, selectivity is a bit more nuanced.  It refers to the antibody's ability to bind *only* to its intended target and not to similar proteins.  YCharOS's approach helps assess this indirectly, by showing how much non-specific binding occurs in the knockout cell line.  More binding there suggests lower selectivity.  But to directly assess selectivity against closely related proteins, you'd need additional experiments, possibly using purified proteins rather than whole cells.  It's a more complex issue.

Sarah:  So, it's not a perfect system, but it's a huge improvement over nothing, right?  And it sounds like the collaborative aspect is crucial to its success.  Getting buy-in from the antibody manufacturers themselves…that’s a significant accomplishment.

Joe:  Absolutely.  That level of collaboration is unprecedented.  It's a testament to the seriousness of the problem and a recognition by manufacturers that quality control needs to be vastly improved.  Otherwise, you know, they risk losing credibility and sales in the long run.

Sarah: You mentioned earlier that even with YCharOS, the issue isn't completely solved.  The OMAPs initiative, for example, seems to tackle the problem from a different angle.  How does their approach differ?

Joe:  OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within specific applications, but across various contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging techniques.  YCharOS, on the other hand, performs more rigorous characterization in a controlled setting, aiming for broader application applicability.  It's two sides of the same coin, really; both are necessary.  One provides a solid foundation, the other explores the real-world performance.  It's a complementary approach.

Sarah:  It sounds like a massive undertaking, requiring a lot of collaboration and resources.  But it's incredibly important work.  Thanks for explaining all of this, Joe.  I think our listeners will appreciate the clarity and the importance of this often-overlooked problem.

One cell line *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is *supposed* to bind to – at normal levels. The other cell line is a \"knockout\" line; it's genetically modified to *lack* that specific protein.  The idea is straightforward: if the antibody is truly specific, it should only bind strongly to the cells containing the target protein and show minimal binding, or no binding at all, in the knockout cells.  That's the key to determining specificity."

It sounds like a massive undertaking, requiring a lot of collaboration and resources.  But it's incredibly important work.  Thanks for explaining all of this, Joe.  I think our listeners will appreciate the clarity and the importance of this often-overlooked problem.

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

 Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about the challenges in identifying and validating antibodies. It sounds like a real mess, honestly.  This whole RRID system…  it’s a step in the right direction, right? But it feels like a band-aid on a much larger wound.

Joe: Yeah, you're right, Sarah.  The RRIDs are a crucial first step, providing a way to actually *find* the antibodies mentioned in research papers. Before,  90% of antibodies cited in some journals lacked catalogue numbers – making them practically untraceable.  Think about trying to replicate a study without knowing *which* antibody the researchers used!  It's impossible. RRIDs give each antibody a unique, persistent identifier, even if the company stops producing it. It’s a significant improvement in tracking, that's for sure.

Sarah:  But even if you *can* find an antibody,  how do you know it's actually any good?  You mentioned this CiteAb search engine.  Is that like a Yelp for antibodies?

Joe: (chuckles) Kind of, I guess.  CiteAb indexes millions of antibodies and shows how often they've been cited, giving you an idea of their popularity.  It also includes validation information when available.  But the problem is, validation is a huge hurdle.  Many researchers rely on knockout validation – essentially, confirming the antibody only targets the intended protein – but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have this kind of validation.

Sarah:  Wow, that's... alarmingly low.  So, what's the solution?  Is it just more funding for validation studies?

Joe:  It's more complex than that, Sarah. It's not just about money, although funding is certainly part of it. The problem is that antibodies are used in so many different ways, across so many different species, that a simple "good" or "bad" label just doesn't cut it.  One antibody might work perfectly for one application, but fail miserably in another.  And even the validation methods themselves are constantly evolving and being refined.

Sarah:  So it's not just about the antibody itself, but how it's used and tested?  It's almost like... the context matters as much as the antibody itself?

Joe: Exactly.  The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is trying to address this by bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers. The goal is to establish better standards, improve communication, and ultimately, increase the reliability of antibody research.  It's a huge collaborative effort, involving many stakeholders, to fix a problem that has plagued the field for a long time.  It's a multifaceted challenge, needing a multifaceted approach.  It’s not a quick fix, you know?

Sarah:  It sounds incredibly complicated.  But it’s also incredibly important work.  Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe. I think our listeners will appreciate understanding the complexities involved in something that many take for granted.

Sarah: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

 Sarah: So, Joe, all this talk about recombinant antibodies… it's fascinating, but also a bit overwhelming.  Can you break down the core difference between, say, traditional antibodies and these recombinant ones?  I'm trying to understand why this shift is so important.

Joe: Sure, Sarah.  The key difference lies in *how* they're made. Traditional antibodies, you know, were often generated from immune cells – think of the body's natural response to an infection. The process is, well, less precise.  You're essentially harvesting antibodies from a complex biological system. This leads to batch-to-batch variability – one batch might be slightly different from the next, affecting the reliability of experiments.

Sarah:  So, inconsistent results are a big problem?

Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* the specific antibody you want. It's like having a highly controlled factory instead of a natural, less predictable process. This allows for much greater consistency and reproducibility.  Each batch should be virtually identical to the last.

Sarah: That makes a lot of sense.  So, it’s like… mass-producing a specific, standardized product rather than harvesting a variable natural resource.

Joe:  Yeah, that's a good analogy, although it's not a perfect one. The main point is the controlled manufacturing process leading to consistent results.

Sarah:  Right. And this increased consistency is crucial for research, right? Because if you're repeating an experiment, you want to be sure the antibody is the same each time.  Otherwise, your results could be skewed.

Joe: Absolutely.  It's fundamental for reproducibility in scientific research.  Inconsistency in antibodies can lead to unreliable data and, um, wasted time and resources.  The move towards recombinant antibodies is a big step towards addressing that.  It's not a complete solution, of course, but it's a significant improvement.

Sarah:  So, is the transition to recombinant antibodies completely seamless?  Are there any challenges?

Joe:  Oh, definitely challenges.  The cost of producing recombinant antibodies can be higher initially. Also, not every antibody is readily available as a recombinant version.  There's a lot of work still to be done to make the full range of antibodies available in this consistent, reproducible format.  Plus, changing established practices in the research community is always a hurdle.  Some scientists might be hesitant to switch to a new method even if it's demonstrably better.

Sarah: That's a common problem in science, I think. People are sometimes resistant to change even when the benefits are clear.  So, what are the main efforts underway to encourage this shift?

Joe: Well, there are several initiatives.  Organizations are working to create databases that help researchers identify high-quality, validated antibodies.  Funders are providing grants to encourage the adoption of best practices, including the use of recombinant antibodies.  And manufacturers are increasing their production of recombinant versions.  It's a multi-pronged approach, and it's showing some positive results.  The percentage of papers using recombinant antibodies is growing.

Sarah:  That's encouraging to hear! It sounds like a collaborative effort across the whole scientific community.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  It's made a complex topic much clearer.

Joe: WAYS TO VALIDATE Researchers test antibodies that they wish to use in several ways. They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry. Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight. And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry Antibodies label cells with the target protein Cells without target protein Western blot Molecular- weight reference ladder Imummoprecipitation Antibodies attached to beads Protein of interest is captured and then confirmed using mass spectrometry A single band is found at the expected molecular weight I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? 28 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature.

 Sarah:  So, Joe, you mentioned several ways to validate these antibodies.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation…  It sounds a bit overwhelming. Can you break it down a little more simply?  Like, what’s the basic idea behind each one?

Joe:  Sure, Sarah.  Let's start with immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you've got a sample of cells, right? And you think certain cells have a specific protein you're interested in.  This technique uses antibodies – which are like tiny, protein-seeking missiles – to find and bind to that protein.  If the antibody binds, it usually has a marker attached, like a fluorescent tag, so you can see under a microscope which cells have the protein.  It's like...  well, maybe it's not like anything, really. It's just a direct way to see if your protein is where you expect it to be in the cells.

Sarah: Okay, so it’s a visual confirmation.  What about Western blotting?

Joe:  Western blotting is different.  It's less about location and more about confirming the *size* and *presence* of your protein. You separate all the proteins in your sample based on size using gel electrophoresis, then transfer them to a membrane. Then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size. If it does, and only at the expected size,  it gives you more confidence that your antibody is actually binding to the right protein.  It's a more precise way to confirm the protein's identity, you know?

Sarah:  So, immunohistochemistry shows *where* the protein is, and Western blotting shows *if* it’s the right protein and its size.  And immunoprecipitation?

Joe:  Immunoprecipitation is a bit more involved.  Think of it like this: you're fishing for your specific protein out of a huge pool of other proteins.  You use your antibody as bait, attached to tiny beads.  The antibody grabs onto your protein, and then you can pull out the beads – and the protein stuck to them – from the rest of the mixture.  Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to precisely identify the protein you've caught. It's a more complex, but also more definitive, way to check.

Sarah:  Wow, that's...thorough. It sounds like a lot of work to make sure the antibodies are reliable.  It makes me appreciate the rigor of scientific research a lot more.  So, all three methods kind of cross-validate each other, right?  One method might not be enough on its own?

Joe: Exactly. Using multiple methods helps to reduce the chance of error.  Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses, so combining them gives you a much more robust validation.  It's all about making sure you're actually studying what you think you're studying.

Sarah:  That's incredibly important. Thanks for explaining all that so clearly, Joe.  I feel like I have a much better understanding now.

Joe:  My pleasure, Sarah.  It’s crucial to understand these validation steps, as they are fundamental to the reliability of scientific findings.  Without careful validation, the conclusions drawn from experiments can easily be misleading.

Sarah: Absolutely.  It's a good reminder of the importance of rigorous methodology in science.

--- Full Generated Conversation ---
[INFO] Joe: Welcome to Science Odyssey, the podcast where we journey through groundbreaking scientific studies, unraveling the mysteries behind the research that shapes our world. Thanks for tuning in!  So, Sarah, today we're diving into a fascinating, and frankly, a bit frustrating, area of research: the reliability of antibodies used in scientific experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: Oh, I've heard whispers about this.  It sounds like a pretty big problem, right?  I mean, if the tools scientists use aren't reliable, how can we trust the results?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly!  Um, the issue is huge.  Take, for example, the work of Carl Laflamme. He was studying a protein, you know, encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, linked to motor neuron disease.  He needed antibodies to identify and track this protein within cells.  But,  and this is the kicker,  the literature was a mess.  Different papers reported wildly different locations for this protein within the cell.  Total chaos.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, so conflicting results.  That doesn't sound good at all.  What was the reason for this discrepancy?
[INFO] Joe: Well, Laflamme suspected the antibodies themselves.  He tested sixteen commercially available antibodies advertised as binding to this specific protein.  Only three actually worked reliably – meaning they bound to the *right* protein and nothing else.  The rest?  A complete waste of time and resources.  And get this, some of the poorly performing antibodies had been used in studies cited thousands of times!
[INFO] Sarah: Thousands of times?! That's astonishing. So,  a lot of published research might be based on unreliable data?
[INFO] Joe: Potentially, yes.  It highlights a massive reproducibility problem in biological sciences.  It's not just Laflamme's experience either.  Many scientists have faced this issue.  Many commercial antibodies simply don't work as advertised.  They might not bind to the target protein specifically, or they might bind to other molecules, leading to false results.
[INFO] Sarah: So, what's being done to fix this?  Is there some sort of quality control initiative?
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  There are several initiatives underway.  One is Antibody Characterization through Open Science, or iCharOS.  This project aims to comprehensively characterize commercially available antibodies for every human protein. It's a huge undertaking, but it's a step in the right direction.  There are also efforts to improve antibody production and to encourage better practices within the scientific community – how researchers select and use these antibodies.  It's a multi-pronged approach involving vendors, funding agencies, and even scientific publishers.
[INFO] Sarah: That sounds promising.  It seems like such a fundamental problem, though.  If the very tools of the trade are unreliable, it must significantly impact the pace of scientific discovery.
[INFO] Joe: You're absolutely right.  It's been a huge bottleneck.  It wastes time, money, and resources.  It also undermines confidence in research findings.  But hopefully, with initiatives like iCharOS and a greater awareness of the problem, we can start to improve the situation.  It's a long road, but the hope is that this will lead to more reliable research and faster progress in biomedical sciences.
[INFO] Sarah: Definitely.  This has been eye-opening, Joe. Thanks for shedding light on this critical issue.  I think our listeners will find this equally fascinating and concerning.
[INFO] Joe: So, Sarah, where were we? Ah yes, the antibody crisis.  The sheer scale of it is, um, staggering.  Millions of antibodies on the market, and a significant portion—we're talking upwards of two-thirds in some studies—simply don't perform as advertised.  It's a massive problem for research reproducibility, you know?
[INFO] Sarah: Exactly.  It's mind-boggling.  And what's even more concerning is that this isn't some niche issue; it affects almost every area of biological research.  This YCharOS initiative, though, seems like a really promising step forward.  But can you explain, in simple terms, how their testing methodology actually works?  They mentioned something about knockout cell lines...
[INFO] Joe: Right. So, YCharOS uses a comparative approach.  They test the antibody's performance in two different cell lines. One cell line *expresses* the target protein – meaning the protein the antibody is *supposed* to bind to – at normal levels. The other cell line is a "knockout" line; it's genetically modified to *lack* that specific protein.  The idea is straightforward: if the antibody is truly specific, it should only bind strongly to the cells containing the target protein and show minimal binding, or no binding at all, in the knockout cells.  That's the key to determining specificity.
[INFO] Sarah: Okay, I think I get that. So, it's a control experiment, essentially.  A very important one, it seems.  But what about selectivity?  Is that tested in a similar way?
[INFO] Joe: Well, selectivity is a bit more nuanced.  It refers to the antibody's ability to bind *only* to its intended target and not to similar proteins.  YCharOS's approach helps assess this indirectly, by showing how much non-specific binding occurs in the knockout cell line.  More binding there suggests lower selectivity.  But to directly assess selectivity against closely related proteins, you'd need additional experiments, possibly using purified proteins rather than whole cells.  It's a more complex issue.
[INFO] Sarah: So, it's not a perfect system, but it's a huge improvement over nothing, right?  And it sounds like the collaborative aspect is crucial to its success.  Getting buy-in from the antibody manufacturers themselves…that’s a significant accomplishment.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  That level of collaboration is unprecedented.  It's a testament to the seriousness of the problem and a recognition by manufacturers that quality control needs to be vastly improved.  Otherwise, you know, they risk losing credibility and sales in the long run.
[INFO] Sarah: You mentioned earlier that even with YCharOS, the issue isn't completely solved.  The OMAPs initiative, for example, seems to tackle the problem from a different angle.  How does their approach differ?
[INFO] Joe: OMAPs focuses on validating antibodies within specific applications, but across various contexts.  Think different tissues, different imaging techniques.  YCharOS, on the other hand, performs more rigorous characterization in a controlled setting, aiming for broader application applicability.  It's two sides of the same coin, really; both are necessary.  One provides a solid foundation, the other explores the real-world performance.  It's a complementary approach.
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds like a massive undertaking, requiring a lot of collaboration and resources.  But it's incredibly important work.  Thanks for explaining all of this, Joe.  I think our listeners will appreciate the clarity and the importance of this often-overlooked problem.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you were talking about the challenges in identifying and validating antibodies. It sounds like a real mess, honestly.  This whole RRID system…  it’s a step in the right direction, right? But it feels like a band-aid on a much larger wound.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, you're right, Sarah.  The RRIDs are a crucial first step, providing a way to actually *find* the antibodies mentioned in research papers. Before,  90% of antibodies cited in some journals lacked catalogue numbers – making them practically untraceable.  Think about trying to replicate a study without knowing *which* antibody the researchers used!  It's impossible. RRIDs give each antibody a unique, persistent identifier, even if the company stops producing it. It’s a significant improvement in tracking, that's for sure.
[INFO] Sarah: But even if you *can* find an antibody,  how do you know it's actually any good?  You mentioned this CiteAb search engine.  Is that like a Yelp for antibodies?
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's... alarmingly low.  So, what's the solution?  Is it just more funding for validation studies?
[INFO] Joe: (chuckles) Kind of, I guess.  CiteAb indexes millions of antibodies and shows how often they've been cited, giving you an idea of their popularity.  It also includes validation information when available.  But the problem is, validation is a huge hurdle.  Many researchers rely on knockout validation – essentially, confirming the antibody only targets the intended protein – but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have this kind of validation.
[INFO] Joe: It's more complex than that, Sarah. It's not just about money, although funding is certainly part of it. The problem is that antibodies are used in so many different ways, across so many different species, that a simple "good" or "bad" label just doesn't cut it.  One antibody might work perfectly for one application, but fail miserably in another.  And even the validation methods themselves are constantly evolving and being refined.
[INFO] Sarah: So it's not just about the antibody itself, but how it's used and tested?  It's almost like... the context matters as much as the antibody itself?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  The Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community is trying to address this by bringing together researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers. The goal is to establish better standards, improve communication, and ultimately, increase the reliability of antibody research.  It's a huge collaborative effort, involving many stakeholders, to fix a problem that has plagued the field for a long time.  It's a multifaceted challenge, needing a multifaceted approach.  It’s not a quick fix, you know?
[INFO] Sarah: It sounds incredibly complicated.  But it’s also incredibly important work.  Thanks for shedding light on this, Joe. I think our listeners will appreciate understanding the complexities involved in something that many take for granted.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, all this talk about recombinant antibodies… it's fascinating, but also a bit overwhelming.  Can you break down the core difference between, say, traditional antibodies and these recombinant ones?  I'm trying to understand why this shift is so important.
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  The key difference lies in *how* they're made. Traditional antibodies, you know, were often generated from immune cells – think of the body's natural response to an infection. The process is, well, less precise.  You're essentially harvesting antibodies from a complex biological system. This leads to batch-to-batch variability – one batch might be slightly different from the next, affecting the reliability of experiments.
[INFO] Sarah: So, inconsistent results are a big problem?
[INFO] Joe: Exactly.  Recombinant antibodies, on the other hand, are produced in genetically engineered cells.  These cells are programmed to produce *only* the specific antibody you want. It's like having a highly controlled factory instead of a natural, less predictable process. This allows for much greater consistency and reproducibility.  Each batch should be virtually identical to the last.
[INFO] Sarah: That makes a lot of sense.  So, it’s like… mass-producing a specific, standardized product rather than harvesting a variable natural resource.
[INFO] Joe: Yeah, that's a good analogy, although it's not a perfect one. The main point is the controlled manufacturing process leading to consistent results.
[INFO] Sarah: Right. And this increased consistency is crucial for research, right? Because if you're repeating an experiment, you want to be sure the antibody is the same each time.  Otherwise, your results could be skewed.
[INFO] Joe: Absolutely.  It's fundamental for reproducibility in scientific research.  Inconsistency in antibodies can lead to unreliable data and, um, wasted time and resources.  The move towards recombinant antibodies is a big step towards addressing that.  It's not a complete solution, of course, but it's a significant improvement.
[INFO] Sarah: So, is the transition to recombinant antibodies completely seamless?  Are there any challenges?
[INFO] Joe: Oh, definitely challenges.  The cost of producing recombinant antibodies can be higher initially. Also, not every antibody is readily available as a recombinant version.  There's a lot of work still to be done to make the full range of antibodies available in this consistent, reproducible format.  Plus, changing established practices in the research community is always a hurdle.  Some scientists might be hesitant to switch to a new method even if it's demonstrably better.
[INFO] Sarah: That's a common problem in science, I think. People are sometimes resistant to change even when the benefits are clear.  So, what are the main efforts underway to encourage this shift?
[INFO] Joe: Well, there are several initiatives.  Organizations are working to create databases that help researchers identify high-quality, validated antibodies.  Funders are providing grants to encourage the adoption of best practices, including the use of recombinant antibodies.  And manufacturers are increasing their production of recombinant versions.  It's a multi-pronged approach, and it's showing some positive results.  The percentage of papers using recombinant antibodies is growing.
[INFO] Sarah: That's encouraging to hear! It sounds like a collaborative effort across the whole scientific community.  Thanks for explaining all this, Joe.  It's made a complex topic much clearer.
[INFO] Sarah: So, Joe, you mentioned several ways to validate these antibodies.  Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation…  It sounds a bit overwhelming. Can you break it down a little more simply?  Like, what’s the basic idea behind each one?
[INFO] Joe: Sure, Sarah.  Let's start with immunohistochemistry.  Basically, you've got a sample of cells, right? And you think certain cells have a specific protein you're interested in.

[INFO] Sarah: Okay, so it’s a visual confirmation.  What about Western blotting?
[INFO] Joe: Western blotting is different.  It's less about location and more about confirming the *size* and *presence* of your protein. You separate all the proteins in your sample based on size using gel electrophoresis, then transfer them to a membrane. Then you use your antibody to see if it binds to a protein of the expected size. If it does, and only at the expected size,  it gives you more confidence that your antibody is actually binding to the right protein.  It's a more precise way to confirm the protein's identity, you know?
[INFO] Sarah: So, immunohistochemistry shows *where* the protein is, and Western blotting shows *if* it’s the right protein and its size.  And immunoprecipitation?

Then, you can use something like mass spectrometry to precisely identify the protein you've caught. It's a more complex, but also more definitive, way to check.
[INFO] Sarah: Wow, that's...thorough. It sounds like a lot of work to make sure the antibodies are reliable.  It makes me appreciate the rigor of scientific research a lot more.  So, all three methods kind of cross-validate each other, right?  One method might not be enough on its own?
