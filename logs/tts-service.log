Text: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it.  It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.  When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein.  The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates.  There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says.  He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell.  So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available.  They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72.  When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades.  Several fresh initiativeshope to change this.  By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules.  But not one published study had used these antibodies.  About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing.  And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1.  Laflammes experience isnt unusual.  Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets.  The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.  Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research.  He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein.  There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules.  Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK.  Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful.  Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction.  This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments.  Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein.  To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked.  For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves.  They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules.  To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.  When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue.  Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world.  In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised.  Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies.  What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies.  When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating.

Text: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge.  The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.  YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate).  In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2.  Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers.  It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS.  It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work.  Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023.  They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market.  The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins.  Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says.  He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names).  I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.  But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says.  The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform.  Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge.  Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs).  OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen.  Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods.  To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs.  Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland.  People are testing things that you would never think you could test.  Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find.  In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles.  After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down.  To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says.  After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs.  Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one.  RRIDs solve this.  In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts.  In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are.  Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers.  We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski.  Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says.

Text: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step.  In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use.  In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies.  Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations.  In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site.  The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says.  Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS.  Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says.  Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies.  In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation.  But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.  When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time.  That was a shock, Virk says.  At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point.  Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies.  In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.  They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research.  Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.  Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality.  It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences.  The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices.  Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.  Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance.  In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made.  The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody.  Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods.  A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

Text: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

[INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah Discuss the Antibody Problem

**Joe:** Hey Sarah, how's it going?

**Sarah:** Doing well, Joe. You know, I was just reading this fascinating article about the challenges with antibodies in research. It seems like a huge problem.

**Joe:** It absolutely is. I mean, imagine spending months on an experiment, only to find out that the antibodies you used weren't even binding to the right protein. It's incredibly frustrating and a massive waste of resources.

**Sarah:** Exactly! And the article mentioned that it's not just a few bad antibodies, but a widespread issue. That's concerning, especially considering the impact it might have on scientific progress.

**Joe:** Oh, it definitely has an impact. It contributes to the reproducibility crisis, where results from one lab can't be replicated by another. This slows down research and makes it difficult to develop new treatments and therapies.

**Sarah:** Right, and it's not just about wasted time and resources. It can also lead to wrong conclusions being drawn, which can be dangerous in fields like medicine.

**Joe:** Absolutely. That's why there's a growing movement to address this issue. One example is the Antibody Characterization through Open Resources (ACRO) project, which aims to evaluate and characterize antibodies before they're widely used.

**Sarah:** That sounds like a great initiative. Do you think it will make a difference?

**Joe:** I certainly hope so. But it's not just about individual projects. We need a cultural shift in how we approach antibodies in research. We need to be more critical of the ones we use and more transparent about their limitations.

**Sarah:** Agreed. And maybe we also need to invest more in developing new, more reliable antibodies.

**Joe:** Absolutely. It's a multi-pronged approach, but I'm optimistic that we can overcome this challenge and improve the reliability of research.

**Sarah:** Me too. It's exciting to think about the potential impact this could have on scientific progress and ultimately, on improving human health.

**Joe:** Couldn't agree more, Sarah. This isn't just about antibodies, it's about building a more robust and reliable foundation for scientific discovery.

**(End of conversation)**

**Visionary statement:**

By tackling the problem of unreliable antibodies, we can pave the way for a future of more robust and reliable scientific research. This will not only accelerate the pace of discovery but also ensure that the results we obtain are accurate and reproducible, ultimately leading to better treatments and a healthier future for all.

[INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah on Antibody Validation

**Sarah:** So, Joe, tell me about this YCharOS initiative. How are they changing the game for antibody validation?

**Joe:** Well, Sarah, YCharOS is a non-profit organization that's tackling a major issue in research: the reliability of antibodies. They test commercially available antibodies to see if they actually work as advertised, and they publish the results openly.

**Sarah:** That sounds incredibly valuable. I mean, antibodies are such a fundamental tool in research, but it's shocking how often they don't perform as expected.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And the consequences of using a bad antibody can be disastrous. It can lead to wasted time, money, and even misleading results. YCharOS is helping to prevent that by providing researchers with a reliable source of information about antibody performance.

**Sarah:** So, how exactly do they test these antibodies?

**Joe:** They use a two-pronged approach. First, they compare the antibody's specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal levels against its performance in a "knock-out" cell line that lacks the protein. This helps to identify antibodies that bind to unintended targets.

**Sarah:** Interesting. And what's the second part of their testing?

**Joe:** They also analyze the antibodies' performance in different tissues and cell types. This is important because the context in which an antibody is used can affect its performance. For example, an antibody that works well in one tissue might not work as well in another.

**Sarah:** That makes sense. So, what kind of impact has YCharOS had so far?

**Joe:** Well, they've already tested over 1,000 antibodies, and they've found that about two-thirds of them don't work as advertised. This has led to manufacturers reassessing and updating their recommendations for many of these antibodies, and some have even been removed from the market.

**Sarah:** Wow, that's a huge impact. It must be reassuring for researchers to know that they can rely on YCharOS's data when choosing antibodies.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And the initiative is still growing. They're aiming to test all 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins. It's a huge undertaking, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we do research.

**Sarah:** This is truly groundbreaking work, Joe. It's exciting to see how YCharOS is paving the way for more reliable and accurate research.

**Joe:** Indeed, Sarah. By improving the quality of antibodies, YCharOS is helping to ensure that scientific research is built on a solid foundation. This will ultimately lead to better understanding of diseases, development of new treatments, and ultimately, improved human health.

A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Antibodies - The Silent Crisis in Reproducibility

**Joe:** Hey Sarah, welcome back to the podcast! Today, we're diving into a topic that's often overlooked but critically important: the reliability of antibodies in scientific research.

**Sarah:** Thanks, Joe! I'm really interested in this. I've heard about issues with antibodies before, but I'm not sure I fully understand the scope of the problem.

**Joe:** Yeah, it's definitely a hidden crisis. Antibodies are used in countless experiments, but many of them are poorly characterized and validated, leading to unreliable results and wasted resources.

**Sarah:** Wow, that's concerning. So, how do we even begin to tackle this issue?

**Joe:** It's a multi-pronged approach. First, we need better ways to track and characterize antibodies. Platforms like CiteAb and YCharOS are making strides in this area, but there's still a long way to go.

**Sarah:** And what about validation? I've heard that knock-out validation is considered the gold standard, but it's not widely used.

**Joe:** Exactly. There's a big gap between what we know we should do and what's actually happening. Initiatives like Only Good Antibodies are trying to bridge that gap by bringing stakeholders together and promoting best practices.

**Sarah:** That sounds promising. What about the manufacturers? Are they playing a role in improving antibody quality?

**Joe:** Some are. There's a shift towards producing more recombinant antibodies, which are more consistent and reproducible. Companies like Abcam are leading the charge in this area.

**Sarah:** It seems like there's a lot of momentum building around this issue. Do you think we'll see significant improvements in the near future?

**Joe:** I'm cautiously optimistic. There's definitely a growing awareness of the problem, and initiatives like OGA and YCharOS are making real progress. But it's going to take a concerted effort from researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers to truly turn the tide.

**Sarah:** Well, it's definitely a worthwhile effort. Improving antibody reliability will not only save time and money, but also lead to more robust and trustworthy scientific research.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And ultimately, that will benefit everyone, from researchers and patients to society as a whole.

**Sarah:** On that note, let's wrap it up for today. Thanks for sharing your insights, Joe!

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. And thanks to our listeners for tuning in!

**Visionary Statement:**

This conversation highlights the critical role that antibodies play in scientific research and the urgent need to address the issue of their reliability. By working together, researchers, manufacturers, funders, and publishers can ensure that the scientific community is equipped with the tools and resources needed to conduct high-quality, reproducible research, ultimately leading to advancements in science and medicine that benefit everyone.

Sarah: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry.  Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight.  And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry.
