[INFO] Text: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it.  It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.  When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein.  The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates.  There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says.  He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell.  So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available.  They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72.  When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades.  Several fresh initiativeshope to change this.  By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules.  But not one published study had used these antibodies.  About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing.  And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1.  Laflammes experience isnt unusual.  Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets.  The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.  Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research.  He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein.  There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules.  Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK.  Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful.  Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction.  This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments.  Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein.  To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked.  For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves.  They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules.  To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.  When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue.  Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world.  In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised.  Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies.  What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies.  When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating.
[INFO] Text: YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge.  The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.  YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate).  In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2.  Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers.  It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS.  It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work.  Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023.  They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market.  The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins.  Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says.  He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names).  I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.  But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says.  The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform.  Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge.  Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs).  OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen.  Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods.  To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs.  Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland.  People are testing things that you would never think you could test.  Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find.  In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles.  After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down.  To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says.  After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs.  Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one.  RRIDs solve this.  In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts.  In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are.  Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers.  We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski.  Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says.
[INFO] Text: That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step.  In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use.  In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies.  Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations.  In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site.  The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says.  Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS.  Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says.  Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies.  In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation.  But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.  When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time.  That was a shock, Virk says.  At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point.  Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies.  In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.  They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research.  Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.  Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality.  It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences.  The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices.  Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.  Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance.  In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made.  The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4.  Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody.  Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods.  A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.
[INFO] Text: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

[INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: The Quest to Rid Labs of Faulty Antibodies

**Joe:** So, Sarah, we were just talking about the frustrating case of those faulty antibodies and how they plagued Carl Laflamme's research. It's a common problem, unfortunately, and one that can have serious consequences for scientific progress.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. I mean, imagine spending months, even years, chasing down a research lead based on faulty data. It's not just a waste of time and resources, it can also lead researchers down the wrong path entirely.

**Joe:** Exactly. And that's why initiatives like Antibody Characterization through Open Resources (ACOR) are so important. They're trying to tackle this problem head-on by providing researchers with reliable, well-characterized antibodies.

**Sarah:** I'm curious, Joe, how exactly do these initiatives work? I mean, how do they ensure that the antibodies they're providing are actually reliable?

**Joe:** Well, one of the key things they do is test each antibody rigorously. They use a variety of techniques to confirm that the antibody binds specifically to its intended target and doesn't cross-react with other molecules.

**Sarah:** That sounds like a crucial step. But what about the antibodies that are already out there? The ones that researchers might already be using in their labs?

**Joe:** That's a good question. ACOR and other initiatives are also working to develop resources that help researchers assess the quality of existing antibodies. They're creating databases and tools that allow researchers to compare different antibodies and see how they've performed in other studies.

**Sarah:** That's fantastic! It's like Consumer Reports for antibodies.

**Joe:** (chuckles) You could say that. The goal is to empower researchers to make informed decisions about which antibodies to use in their research.

**Sarah:** I think this is a huge step forward for scientific research. It has the potential to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of results, which could ultimately accelerate scientific discovery and drug development.

**Joe:** I couldn't agree more, Sarah. Initiatives like ACOR are paving the way for a future where faulty antibodies are a thing of the past. And that's a future that will benefit not only researchers, but also society as a whole.

**Sarah:** Well said, Joe. This conversation has really opened my eyes to the importance of reliable antibodies in scientific research. I'm excited to see how these initiatives continue to develop and make a real impact on the scientific landscape.

[INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Joe and Sarah Discuss Antibody Validation

**Sarah:** Welcome back to the show, Joe! Today we're diving into the world of antibodies, those tiny but critical tools used in countless scientific experiments. But it turns out, not all antibodies are created equal. Tell us about the YCharOS initiative and how it's tackling this challenge.

**Joe:** Absolutely, Sarah. YCharOS stands for "Yet Another Antibody Characterization Resource for Open Science." It's a collaborative effort aimed at rigorously evaluating the performance of commercially available antibodies. 

**Sarah:** So, how exactly does YCharOS test these antibodies?

**Joe:** They use a clever approach. They compare the antibody's specificity in two different cell lines. One line expresses the target protein at normal levels, while the other, called a "knock-out" line, lacks the protein entirely. This allows them to assess how well the antibody binds to its intended target and how much it binds to other, unintended molecules.

**Sarah:** Fascinating! And what did they find?

**Joe:** Well, in a recent study published in eLife, they analyzed 614 antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Shockingly, two-thirds of them didn't perform as advertised by the manufacturers. 

**Sarah:** Wow, that's a lot! So, what happens when an antibody fails the test?

**Joe:** The manufacturers are notified, and they can then reassess the antibody and update their recommendations or even remove it from the market. In fact, over half of the flagged antibodies were re-evaluated, and 153 received updated recommendations, while 73 were pulled entirely.

**Sarah:** That's definitely a step in the right direction. But with millions of antibodies available, how much work is left to be done?

**Joe:** A lot, actually. YCharOS has tested over 1,000 antibodies so far, but that's just a fraction of the estimated 200,000 unique antibodies targeting human proteins.

**Sarah:** It seems like a daunting task. But what impact could initiatives like YCharOS have on scientific research?

**Joe:** It's huge, Sarah. By ensuring the accuracy and reliability of antibodies, we can improve the reproducibility and ultimately the trustworthiness of scientific findings. This can lead to better drug development, more accurate diagnoses, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of human health and disease.

**Sarah:** That's a powerful vision, Joe. Thanks for sharing your insights on this critical topic.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. It's exciting to see how initiatives like YCharOS are paving the way for a more reliable and robust future for scientific research.

A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies.  For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio.  Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam.  Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing.  Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense.  Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says.

[INFO] Joe: Okay, so let's talk about the current state of antibodies in research. As you know, antibodies are essential tools for a wide range of experiments, from studying protein interactions to developing new therapies. However, there's been growing concern about the reliability and reproducibility of antibodies, which can lead to inaccurate results and wasted resources.

Sarah: Right, I've definitely heard about this issue. Can you give me some specific examples of how unreliable antibodies can impact research?

Joe: Sure. One example is in cancer research. Many studies have relied on antibodies to target specific proteins in cancer cells. However, some of these antibodies have been found to be ineffective or even to cross-react with other proteins, leading to false positive results. This can have serious consequences, as it can delay the development of effective treatments.

Sarah: Wow, that's concerning. So, what's being done to address this issue?

Joe: There are a number of initiatives underway to improve the quality and reliability of antibodies. One important aspect is validation. Researchers are increasingly using techniques like knockout validation to confirm that antibodies are actually binding to the target protein and not to other proteins.

Sarah: That makes sense. But what about the antibodies that are already in use? How can we be sure that they're reliable?

Joe: That's a good question. There are a few resources available to help researchers assess the quality of antibodies. One is CiteAb, a search engine that provides information on the validation status of antibodies. Another is the Antibody Validation Database, which is a repository of data on antibody performance.

Sarah: Those sound like helpful resources. But what about the broader impact of this issue? How does it affect science and society as a whole?

Joe: The problem of unreliable antibodies has a significant impact on scientific research. It can lead to wasted time and resources, as well as to inaccurate results that can mislead the scientific community. Ultimately, this can slow down the pace of scientific progress and hinder the development of new treatments and therapies.

Sarah: That's a really important point. So, what can be done to ensure that antibodies are used responsibly and effectively in research?

Joe: I think it's important to promote awareness of the issue and to encourage researchers to use validated antibodies whenever possible. Additionally, funding agencies and publishers can play a role in rewarding researchers who adopt best practices for antibody use.

Sarah: I agree. It's important to take a multi-pronged approach to address this issue. By working together, we can ensure that antibodies are used responsibly and effectively in research, ultimately leading to more reliable and reproducible results.

Joe: Exactly. And by improving the quality of antibodies, we can accelerate scientific progress and improve human health.

Sarah: CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade.  About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants.  Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive.  Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge.  There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says.  If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says.  Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations.  Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change.  Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says.  What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.

They can stain a sample of cells that express a protein of interest using immunohistochemistry.  Western blotting can reveal whether an antibody binds to a specific protein with an expected molecular weight.  And scientists can use immunoprecipitation to pull the protein out of a mixture and then check its identity using mass spectrometry.

[INFO] ## Podcast Conversation: Antibodies - A Revolution in Reliability

**Joe:** Hey Sarah, welcome back to the podcast! Today, we're diving deep into the fascinating world of antibodies and the ongoing revolution in their reliability.

**Sarah:** Thanks, Joe! This is a topic that's been on my mind lately, especially with all the recent discussions about reproducibility in research. So, what's the big deal with antibodies, and why are they so important?

**Joe:** Well, antibodies are like tiny detectives in the body. They're proteins that recognize and bind to specific molecules, essentially tagging them for the immune system to take action. In research, we use them for a huge range of applications, from studying protein interactions to developing new therapies.

**Sarah:** I remember learning about antibodies in school, but I didn't realize they were used so extensively in research. So, what's the problem with their reliability?

**Joe:** It's a bit of a complex issue, but essentially, some antibodies don't always do what they're supposed to. They might bind to the wrong target, or they might not bind at all. This can lead to inaccurate results and wasted resources, which is a major concern in the scientific community.

**Sarah:** That sounds like a big problem. Are there any specific examples of how unreliable antibodies have impacted research?

**Joe:** Absolutely. There have been cases where cancer studies have been based on antibodies that were later found to be ineffective. This can delay the development of new treatments and even mislead researchers about the mechanisms of the disease.

**Sarah:** Wow, that's concerning. So, what's being done to address this issue?

**Joe:** Thankfully, there are a lot of initiatives underway to improve the quality and reliability of antibodies. One important aspect is validation. Researchers are increasingly using techniques like knockout validation to confirm that antibodies are actually binding to the target protein and not to other proteins.

**Sarah:** That makes sense. Are there any resources available to help researchers choose reliable antibodies?

**Joe:** Definitely. There are databases like CiteAb and the Antibody Validation Database that provide information on the validation status of antibodies. These resources are invaluable for researchers who want to make sure they're using the best possible tools for their experiments.

**Sarah:** This is all really interesting, Joe. I never realized how much effort goes into ensuring the reliability of antibodies.

**Joe:** It's a crucial aspect of scientific research, Sarah. By improving the quality of antibodies, we can accelerate scientific progress and ultimately improve human health.

**Sarah:** That's a powerful statement, Joe. I think this conversation has really highlighted the importance of reliable antibodies and the impact they can have on science and society.

**Joe:** Absolutely. And it's important to remember that this is an ongoing effort. We need to continue to invest in research and development to ensure that antibodies are reliable and effective tools for scientific discovery.

**Sarah:** Well said, Joe. Thanks for sharing your insights with us today.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah. I'm always happy to talk about science and its impact on the world.
