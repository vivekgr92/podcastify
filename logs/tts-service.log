Joe: C arl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neuro- logical condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease. When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious mol- ecule operates. There was so much confusion in the field, Laflamme says. He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were adver- tised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them THE QUEST TO RID LABS OF THE REAGENTS THAT RUIN EXPERIMENTS Poorly performing antibodies have plagued biomedicalsciences for decades. Several fresh initiativeshope to change this. By Diana Kwon ILLUSTRATION BY FABIO BUONOCORE 26 | Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 Feature through their paces, only three performed wellmeaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didnt even bind the key protein in Laflammes testing. And those papers had been collec- tively cited more than 3,000 times 1 . Laflammes experience isnt unusual. Scien- tists have long known that many commercial antibodies dont work as they should they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a repro - ducibility crisis in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development. Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced Icarus), an initiative that aims to characterize commer- cially available research antibodies for every human protein. There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best prac- tices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physicianscientist at the University of Leicester, UK. Its hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change but Im hopeful. Putting antibodies to the test The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify spe- cific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity a strong affinity for the target and selectivity the ability to leave other proteins unmarked. For decades, scientists created these anti- bodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer- term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from ani- mals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells.

[INFO] Sarah: Wow, Joe, that's a fascinating story. So, basically, a lot of the antibodies scientists are using are just…bad?  They don't actually do what they're supposed to?

Joe:  Yeah, um, exactly.  It's a bigger problem than you might think.  This Laflamme study really highlights it.  He was looking at this specific protein linked to motor neuron disease, right? And he found that out of sixteen commercially available antibodies supposedly targeting this protein, only three actually worked properly.  The rest either didn't bind to the target protein at all, or they bound to other things too –  which completely messes up the results.

Sarah:  So, three out of sixteen… that's a pretty low success rate.  And these are commercially available antibodies, meaning scientists are paying money for these things, relying on them to be accurate? That's shocking.  I mean, how can this even happen?  Is it just poor quality control from the companies selling them?

Joe:  It's a complex issue, ah, there isn't just one single cause.  Part of it is definitely quality control, or rather, the lack thereof.  There haven't historically been, um, really stringent standards for testing and validating these antibodies.  But it's also, you know, the way they're made.  The process of producing antibodies is inherently complex, and even small variations in the process can lead to antibodies with different properties.  And then there's the issue of… how do I put this…  the incentives.  Companies might be incentivized to sell more antibodies, rather than focusing on the quality of each one.

Sarah:  Right, so it’s a combination of things.  Lack of regulation, complex production, and potentially even business pressures.  This whole thing sounds incredibly frustrating for researchers.  They're spending time, money, and effort on experiments that could be completely invalidated because of a faulty antibody.

Joe:  Absolutely.  It's a huge waste of resources, and as the article mentions, it's contributed to this reproducibility crisis in science.  You know, scientists struggle to replicate each other's findings, and a significant part of that could be traced back to unreliable reagents like these antibodies.  That's why initiatives like iCharOS are so important—they're trying to systematically test and validate these antibodies.

Sarah: So iCharOS is essentially trying to create a database of properly vetted antibodies?  That sounds like a huge undertaking.

Joe:  It is a massive undertaking.  They aim to characterize antibodies for every human protein.  That's a lot of work, but, um, it’s really crucial for the future of biomedical research.  It's about establishing better standards and making sure researchers have access to reliable tools.  It’s a step towards improving reproducibility and ultimately, accelerating scientific discovery.  It's a long road, but hopefully, this will change things.

Joe: When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350antibody suppliers around the world. In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies. What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from com- panies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collab- orating. YCharOSs industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initia- tive (which include various non-profit organ- izations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published. YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in whats called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see Ways to validate). In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65neuroscience-related proteins 2 . Two- thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers. It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are, says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. It shows you how important it is to include that nega- tive control in the work. Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 anti- bodies that are meant to bind to more than 100human proteins. Theres still a lot of work ahead, Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names). I think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference, says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. But its not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently, she says. The context in which anti- bodies are used can change how they perform. Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping con- sortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are col- lections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs. Vendors cannot test all possible applica- tions of their antibodies, but as a community we can say lets try this, says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instru- mentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. People are testing things that you would never think you could test.

[INFO] **(Sound of upbeat intro music fades)**

**Sarah:** Welcome back to the podcast, everyone! Today, we’re diving into the fascinating, and frankly, sometimes frustrating world of research antibodies.  With me is Joe, a biochemist who’s been following this field closely. Joe, thanks for joining us.

**Joe:** Hey Sarah, thanks for having me. It’s a topic that’s closer to my heart than most people realize – I’ve lost count of the hours spent troubleshooting antibody issues!

**Sarah:** (laughs) I can imagine! So, let’s start with the basics.  For our listeners who aren't familiar, can you explain what the problem is with commercially available antibodies?

**Joe:** Sure. Um, well, there are millions of antibodies on the market, right?  Sold by hundreds of companies.  The problem is, historically, there wasn't a standardized way to ensure their quality.  Many manufacturers, ah, didn’t always thoroughly test their antibodies for specificity and selectivity.  What that means is that some antibodies might bind to unintended targets, giving you false positive results, or they might not bind strongly enough to the intended target, giving you false negatives.  Essentially, a lot of them just didn’t work as advertised.

**Sarah:** So, it’s like buying a tool that doesn't quite fit the job?

**Joe:**  You could say that, although it's more nuanced than just a simple tool analogy.  It's more like buying a wrench that sometimes fits, sometimes doesn't, and you only find out after you've already started working.  And the consequences can be pretty significant in research.

**Sarah:**  Absolutely.  So, what's being done to address this?  I've heard about YCharOS.

**Joe:** Yeah, YCharOS is a really interesting initiative.  Basically, they’re systematically testing commercially available antibodies. They’ve got a unique approach; they've collaborated with a large number of antibody suppliers, who actually provide the antibodies for testing free of charge.  They compare the antibody's performance in a cell line that has the target protein with one that doesn't.  This allows them to assess specificity.

**Sarah:** That sounds rigorous. But how effective has it been?

**Joe:**  In one of their published studies, they tested over 600 antibodies and found that two-thirds didn't perform as expected.  That's a pretty staggering number.  And, importantly, based on YCharOS's findings, manufacturers have reassessed many of their antibodies, issuing updates or removing products from the market.

**Sarah:** Wow. So it's not just identifying problems, but actually leading to concrete changes?

**Joe:** Exactly.  It's a collaborative effort that’s forcing a much-needed level of accountability in the field.  However, it's important to note that even with YCharOS's work,  the context matters. An antibody might work perfectly in one cell type but not another.

**Sarah:**  Right, that makes sense.  And there are other initiatives, like OMAPs, focusing on different aspects of antibody validation, correct?

**Joe:** Yes, OMAPs takes a slightly different approach. They're focusing on validating antibodies for a specific application – multiplex imaging – but across various contexts, like different tissues and imaging methods. It's a community-based validation effort.

**Sarah:** So, it sounds like a multi-pronged attack on this problem. It's a huge undertaking.

**Joe:** Absolutely.  There are still a lot of antibodies to test, and the challenge of context-dependent performance remains.  But initiatives like YCharOS and OMAPs are making significant strides toward improving the reliability of research antibodies.  It's a step in the right direction for the whole research community.

**(Sound of upbeat outro music fades in)**

**Sarah:**  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this important topic.  And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in!

Joe: Expanding the toolbox Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by ven- dors to label specific products)making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, its important to have the right reagents and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says. After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a com- pany discontinues a product and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this. In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project 3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000journals have adopted policies that It never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are. Nature | Vol 635 | 7 November 2024 | 27 request these identifiers. We currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers, says Bandrowski. Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. That wont change repro- ducibility by itself, but it is the first step. In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOSs characterization data onto its site. The big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many dif- ferent species that you cant tick off that an anti- body is good or bad, Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. Theres a long way to go, Chalmers says. Stakeholders get involved Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable. When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didnt detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. That was a shock, Virk says. At that point, I wanted to leave science because if things are really this unreliable, whats the point? Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first work- shop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies.

**Sarah:** Welcome back to the show, everyone! Today, we're diving into the surprisingly messy world of antibodies – the workhorses of biological research.  I'm here with Joe, a researcher who's been knee-deep in this, shall we say, *interesting* area. Joe, welcome!

**Joe:** Thanks for having me, Sarah. It's a pleasure to be here.  It's… well, it's more complicated than most people realize.

**Sarah:**  Complicated is an understatement! I've read some articles, and it sounds like a huge problem.  Researchers are spending time and money on antibodies that just… don't work.  Can you give us the lay of the land?

**Joe:**  Absolutely. Um, the core issue is reproducibility.  You know, scientists need reliable antibodies to conduct experiments.  But a significant portion – and we're talking a *huge* portion – of commercially available antibodies are poorly characterized or simply don't target the intended protein accurately.  This means experiments might yield unreliable results, making it difficult to replicate findings.

**Sarah:** So, if I understand correctly, a researcher might buy an antibody, believing it will bind to a specific protein, but it might actually bind to something else entirely, or not bind at all?

**Joe:** Exactly.  And this isn't just a minor inconvenience.  It wastes time, money, and resources. It also undermines the credibility of scientific research.

**Sarah:**  Wow.  So what are some of the attempts to tackle this problem?  I read about something called RRIDs…

**Joe:**  Right. RRIDs, or Research Resource Identifiers, are unique codes assigned to antibodies and other research resources. Think of them as permanent, globally unique identifiers.   Before RRIDs, a lot of papers just cited an antibody by its name, which wasn't very helpful because companies can change names, discontinue products, or even use the same name for different products.  RRIDs solve that problem, providing a permanent link to a specific antibody, regardless of commercial availability.


**Sarah:** That makes a lot of sense.  So it's like a universal product code for research supplies?

**Joe:**  You could say that, although it’s a bit more sophisticated than a simple barcode. It's a persistent identifier even if the commercial product disappears.

**Sarah:** Okay, and what about the issue of actually *finding* a good antibody? Is there anything out there to help researchers choose wisely?

**Joe:**  Yeah, there are resources emerging, like CiteAb.  It's a search engine that aggregates information on antibodies, including citation counts and, increasingly, validation data.  The more an antibody is cited in successful publications, the more likely it is to be reliable.  But even CiteAb can't solve everything.  Validation is still a big hurdle.

**Sarah:**  So, even with these databases, it's still a bit of a gamble?

**Joe:**  Unfortunately, yes.  A lot of antibodies lack rigorous validation.  There's a lot of work needed to establish proper standards and improve the overall quality control in antibody production.

**Sarah:**  So, what's the overall outlook?  Is there hope for a future where researchers can trust their antibodies?

**Joe:**  There's definitely hope. Initiatives like the Only Good Antibodies community are bringing together stakeholders – researchers, manufacturers, funding agencies, publishers – to collaboratively address this issue.  It's a complex problem requiring a multi-faceted approach, but progress is being made.  It's a slow, incremental process, but the awareness is growing, and that's crucial.

**Sarah:**  That’s reassuring.  Joe, thank you so much for shedding light on this crucial issue.  This has been a really informative conversation.

**Joe:** My pleasure, Sarah.

Joe: They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them. Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester the first outside Canada which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives. Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also alter- ing the way some of their products are made. The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies gener- ated by immune cells or immunecancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies 4 . Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells pro- grammed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch a key problem with the older methods. A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. Facilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improv- ing reproducibility, says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. Thats something that antibody suppliers should be doing. Rob Meijers, director of the antibody plat- form at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant anti- bodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. Theyre much more reproduc- ible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive, he says. CiteAbs data have revealed that scientists behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. Thats a big change from where we were ten years ago, says Chalmers, who is now CiteAbs chief executive. Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers dont want to hear that an antibody theyve been using for their experi- ments isnt actually doing what its meant to, Williams says. If somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, its being used regard- less, even if its certain that it doesnt bind this protein, Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, you can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations. Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. Im optimistic that things are getting better, Radtke says. What Im so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.
